DeuTex 4.4.902

DESCRIPTION

    DeuTex and DeuSF are programs than can do many things with Doom,
    Heretic, Hexen and Strife wad files such as extracting and inserting
    graphics, sounds, levels and other resources. See the manual for
    details (dtexman6.txt).

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ON UNIX

    You need a reasonably standard Unix environment with a C compiler.

    The first step is to type

	./configure

    If you need to install somewhere else than /usr/local, give
    ./configure the --prefix option. For example, to install in ~/deutex,

	./configure --prefix ~/deutex

    The C compiler is auto-detected. If the auto-detection does not find
    your compiler, use the --cc option :

	./configure --cc ~/mycc-1.2.3/mycc

    The default CFLAGS is "-O2 -Wall" for GCC, "-O" for other compilers.
    The default LDFLAGS is empty. To override these, you can use the
    --cflags and/or the --ldflags options. For example,

	./configure --cflags '-O2 -m64' --ldflags '-m64'

    After ./configure completes successfully, type

	make

    Finally, type

	make install

    Note that you will need to type this last command as root if you're
    installing in /usr/local or some other "system" directory.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ON DOS

================= RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 4.0 ==================

		 THIS MANUAL IS NOT UP TO DATE !
			READ THIS FIRST !

For a complete list of all the changes between DeuTex 3.6 and
Deutex 4.0, see the CHANGES file. Here is a quick summary of the
important features.

1. The default transparent colour has been changed from cyan (0,
   255, 255) to dark blue-green (0, 47, 47).

   If you try to build with DeuTex 4 a wad from old graphics files
   that use cyan (0, 255, 255) for the transparent areas, there
   will be no error message but the parts that were supposed to be
   transparent will come out as opaque, light blue or white areas.

   The easiest solution in the short term is to run DeuTex with
   the option "-rgb 0 255 255" when building. The best long-term
   solution is to change your images so that they use (0, 47, 47)
   instead of (0, 255, 255). For BMP and GIF images, you can do
   that very quickly by editing the palette. For PPM images, use
   the flood fill function of your graphics editor.

2. Flats are now put between FF_START and F_END so you don't need
   DeuSF anymore to put flats in pwads. "It just works, right out
   of the box !"

3. Doom alpha 0.4 and Doom alpha 0.5 are now supported. To extract
   the contents of the iwads,

     deutex -doom04 c:\doom0_4 -xtract
     deutex -doom05 c:\doom0_5 -xtract

   Some graphics are extracted as lumps (GNUM[0-9]). Levels are
   not extracted properly yet. You will see at lot of warnings
   like

     Warning: ** Not enough entry in level **
     Warning: ** will not overwrite file ./lumps/flatname.lmp **
     Warning: ** will not overwrite file ./lumps/points.lmp **
     Warning: ** will not overwrite file ./lumps/lines.lmp **
     Warning: ** will not overwrite file ./lumps/sectors.lmp **
     Warning: ** will not overwrite file ./lumps/things.lmp **

   Ignore them. To extract levels from the Doom alphas, use Yadex
   (http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/yadex/).

4. Doom press release pre-beta is now supported. To extract the
   contents of the iwad,

     deutex -doompr c:\doomdemo -xtract

5. Hexen is now partly supported (still a lot to do). New
   command-line switch -hexen. To extract the contents of the
   iwad,

     deutex -hexen c:\hexen -xtract

6. Strife is now fairly well supported (some remaining glitches).
   New command-line switches -strife and -strife10. To extract the
   contents of the iwad,

     deutex -strife10 c:\strife -xtract   (Strife 1.0)
     deutex -strife   c:\strife -xtract   (Strife 1.1 and above)

7. New command-line switch -doom2.

8. New command -usedidx.

9. Easier to build on Unix systems, especially Linux. On DOS and
   Windows, now builds with DJGPP, Cygwin and MSC 6.0. There
   shouldn't be any endianness problems now.

10. DeuTex is now libre (GPL + LGPL + PBMPLUS license).

11. The GIF format is deprecated. It will be removed. See
    http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/Gif/Gif.html to know why. Move
    to BMP or PPM. The default graphics format for Unix is now
    PPM.

12. Assorted bug fixes.

************************** CONVIVIALITY ******************************

For obvious reasons of reliability and portability, this tool is not
GUI oriented, and learning to use it will be as painful as learning
to use some complex Unix command.
If you're not a Unix kind of guy, get WinTex, a cool Visual Basic
program that I wrote for people like you. It has all the power of
DeuTex (since it can call DeuTex) but it's much easier to use.

***********************************************************************



+   *NEW* - Lines beginning with a '+' indicate information added since
+   the manual for DeuTex v3.1 came out.
+   DeuTex 3.6 is mainly compatible with version 3.4 to 3.1 but not with
+   versions 2.9 and below. Changes are minor, however.

 As of version 3.6, DeuTex/DeuSF can be considered as finished.
 Almost all the features a normal human would require are there
 I only need to add something to build/modify a wad fast, in order
 to facilitate the building of preview pwads. Normally, the join
 commands should make this useless, but you never know...

 The sources of DeuTex 3.4 are out, and those of DeuTex 3.6 should
 follow soon. They might be out when you read this manual.

                                DeuTex
                             ------------

DeuTex stands stands for DEU's Texture Companion, because it used to
deal only with Doom textures. Now it can do much more!
DEU is a Doom level editor by Brendon Wyber and Raphael Quinet, and
DeuTex was originally derived from the code of DEU 5.21. DeuTex uses
various contributions for particular file formats.

DEUTEX Features:

-  Ported on all Doom platforms (DOS,OS/2,Linux,SGIx,Unix)
-  Reverse engineer existing pwads.
-  Compose your own wall Textures, by reusing existing Doom
   patches or adding your own patches as .BMP or .GIF files.
-  Load sounds as .WAV, .AU or .VOC files.
-  Load PC Speaker sounds as a serial of number (in text).
-  Load music entries as .MUS files. (from MIDItoMUS)
-  Add your own floors.
-  Add your own sprites.
-  Simple wad creation directives from a text file.
-  Simple directory structure for the resources.
-  Work in batch mode, like a compiler.
-  A Windows shell can be used to make your life easier.
-  Compatible with Level editors (like DEU,WinDEU).
-  Merge a pwad into the main iwad, recreating the wad directory,
   so that ANY or ALL kinds of sprites and/or Flats can be defined,
   while distributing only the changed ones in the pwad.
-  Extract Graphics, Bitmaps and Lumps out of your favorite pwad,
   for contemplation or reuse. (WITH wad AUTHOR AGREEMENT ONLY!)
-  Check your pwad for errors in Texture definitions.
-  Create animated walls with (almost) any sequence of pictures.
-  Create a non repeating sky Texture.

                             -------------

DeuSF stands for DEU Sprite and Flats. It is mainly used to
compensate a bug in Doom sprite and flats handling.

DeuSF was inspired by DMADDS by Bernd Kreimeier, but is more powerful
and much cleaner. Like DMADDS, DeuSF compensates for a bug in Doom
concerning the treatment of external sprite and flat pwads. It will
enables you to distribute pwads containing only the sprites and/or flats
that you wish to replace. There are some caveats here, so read the
manual! DeuSF can read DMADDS files, but its' preferred pwad composer is
of course DeuTex, since pwads composed for DMADDS are very dirty inside.

DEUSF Features:

-  Recreate a complete sprite and/or Flat pwad from a partial sprite
   and/or Flat pwad and the main wad of Doom.

WARNING: The sprite names VILE[, VILE\ and VILE] are not valid DOS file
        names, so DeuTex replaces them with VILE$, VILE@ and VILE# when
        extracting them to files. Use these names for your files, too.

                                                                  page v


***************************** WHAT'S NEW? *****************************

+ New in DeuTex 4.0
+ - Lots :-)

+ New in DeuTex 3.8
+ - ?

  New in DeuTex 3.6
 
  - Possibility to take an entry from an existing pwad
    If the file that contains your entry as extension .wad, deutex will
    attempt to read it, and find your entry inside it.
  - Bug corrections (there was still some left...)
  - Wall patches must now be explicitly declared. If they are not,
    DeuTex will try to find them in PATCHES\, as usual.

  New in DeuTex 3.5
 
  -  Bug corrections, as usual (there can't be much left!)
  -  New command -s_end for those that use new sprite names...
  -  Detection of textures that can cause Medusa effect


  Added in DeuTex 3.4

 -  Many many corrections of small bugs (and compiler errors, dammit!)
 -  function -usedtex to find the texture use in all levels
 -  Overwrite switch (-o) to replace data (when you really want it).
 -  A fully working merge and join function (I hope)
 -  Improved support for WinTex

  Added in DeuTex 3.3

 -  Added a -get function to retrieve a single wad entry
 -  Improvements to -merge so that it can be used with Heretic
      NOTE: HERETIC V1.0 CAN'T USE EXTERNAL SPRITE wad.
      THIS IS A BUG IN HERETIC, NOT DEUTEX, DEUSF OR NWT
 -  Sound formats corrected (at least) but compression not supported.
 -  Now -merge and -app, -join preserve the file time, not only the
    contents so that you can still patch your iwad after -merge.
 -  A _DEUTEX_ entry is added in the wad directory
 - New [MUSICS] section and MUSICS subdirectory.
 - Small patch to prevent DCK from bugging at modified iwads
 - DeuTex can now read duplicate sections in Wadinfo.txt
   when extracting new data, if wadinfo.txt exist , it appended

          SUPPORTED

CHAPTER 1
****************************** OVERVIEW *******************************

DeuTex is a GREAT program!

<editors note>
(preceding claim inserted over the objections of Olivier Montanuy) ;-)


*********************** A Note About This Manual ***********************

There is a lot of redundancy in the manual. This is intentional. The
manual is intended to be used as a reference. When you have a question
on a particular aspect of DeuTex, look up a likely entry in the Table of
Contents, and read that entry. It should have the information you need.
This is to prevent you from having to jump around from page to page to
figure out a procedure in DeuTex. This doesn't mean that sections are
identical. Each section attacks a problem from a different viewpoint.
If one section doesn't help you, maybe a different 'angle' will.

************************************************************************

This manual has a lot of trees in it. This chapter will give you a view
of the forest. DeuTex and DeuSF are powerful programs that will let you
do almost anything you can imagine in composing or manipulating pwads.
Notice the word composing. Deutex is an Orchestra Conductor. It can
perform whatever music you write for it brilliantly, but you must
supply the musicians. A pwad consists of many parts. DeuTex coordinates
those parts to give you the pwad you desire, but it doesn't create
them. With DeuTex you have access to all the resources in the Doom1 or
Doom2 iwads. Since it does so many things, it might seem a little
confusing at first glance. Don't worry. If you are familiar with Doom
(read Matt Fell's Doom specs and Hank Leukart's DoomFAQ), then all you
need to learn about DeuTex is it's organization.

There are so many resources in Doom that it isn't reasonable to put them
all in one directory. DeuTex uses a subdirectory for each entry type.
Using these subdirectories is easy once they're explained.

Deutex makes it possible to use a simple, straightforward method for
working with custom graphics (and sounds).  The approach is as follows:

 1) Put your resource files in subdirectories such as FLATS, SPRITES,
        etc., further discussed below.

 2) Use a `Wadinfo' file called something like `goodies.txt' to tell
        Deutex how to assemble the resources into a pwad.

 3) Run `deutex -make goodies.txt goodies.wad' to make the pwad.

Now you can play your level with the resources, without any fuss
(unless, of course, something has gone wrong along the way).




                                                                  page 1




This method works for any resource. You can make sound-only wads that
will play with any version of Doom. You can include Level maps in a
multi-level pwad. DeuTex will put the Levels where you want them,
regardless of the internal EnMm OR MAPnm of the Level. If the finished
pwad doesn't contain new sprites or Flats, it can be played as is.
Otherwise, it can be rendered playable with DeuSF, which can be freely
distributed with your pwads.

The DeuTex Visual Basic shell let's you use the Windows environment to
distribute those entries in the right directory, and then execute the
-make command. It doesn't change the way DeuTex works, it only makes
your life easier.

                           ---------------
A)                         WHAT IS DEUTEX?
                           ---------------

DeuTex is a pwad compiler. It allows you to organize ALL the resources
you modify, and group them into your pwad in a single step. This
eliminates the need for running a different program for each type of
editing you want to do (DMAUD, DMGRAPH, DMADDS, etc).

DeuTex is NOT a:
                map editor,          (use DEU, DoomCAD, WadEdit...)
                nodes builder,       (use DEU, BSP, IDBSP,...)
                reject map builder   (use RMB or REJECT)
                DOOM.EXE editor      (use DEHACKED)

Your Level map with nodes, reject and blockmap already calculated is
just another resource to DeuTex. If you don't want to redefine or create
Textures, Flats, sounds, etc. in your pwad, you don't need DeuTex.

       On the other hand, if you redefine LOTS of stuff,
       you'll wonder how you ever got along without it.

If you've worked with wads before, you know how many times you have to
go in and change something! With DeuTex, you just edit the resource you
want to change, throw it back in it's subdirectory, and run a batch
file to put everything together again.

                            ------------
B)                          INSTALLATION
                            ------------

DeuTex comes in zipped format. Naturally, you need a copy of PKUNZIP
(v2.04G) to unzip it. If you don't have one, go get it! It's probably
available the same place you got DeuTex. PKUNZIP also exist for Unix.

The file name is DEUTEX35.ZIP or something like it. This manual is valid
for DeuTex versions 3.6 and above. Some information is not applicable to
previous versions, and may cause you problems. Be forewarned!

Installing DeuTex:

DeuTex and DeuSF should be put somewhere in your path, e.g. under
C:\DOS in DOS, ~/bin under Linux/Unix, etc. This is not ABSOLUTELY
necessary, as you can put a copy in your working directory each time
or specify path names in all the commands, but, believe me, it makes
life much simpler.


                                                                  page 2




You should enable DeuTex/DeuSF to locate your Doom or Doom2 files
by creating an environment variable DOOMWADDIR that points to
your Doom path like this:

For DOS, put the line 'SET DOOMWADDIR=C:\GAMES\DOOM' in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

For Unix with sh, ksh or Bash, use 'export DOOMWADDIR=~/games/doom'
in .profile.

For Unix with csh or tcsh, use 'setenv DOOMWADDIR ~/games/doom' in .tcshrc.

This is more important for the Linux/Unix version, since with DOS
the command deutex -doom <doomdir> will achieve the same result. In
DOS, it's possible to get an 'out of environment space' error if you
have too many variables defined in autoexec.bat (including path, etc).
If this occurs, use DOS Help for the SHELL command to find out how to
increase your environment space.

       Of course, DeuTex will only work if the REGISTERED
       version DOOM.wad or DOOM2.wad is available.

Should you be in dire need of disk space, or should you wish to use
DeuTex on a machine that can't run Doom, you can use DeuTex to build a
fake DOOM.wad or DOOM2.wad, keeping only the structure of the directory
and the entries PLAYPAL, TEXTURE1, TEXTURE2 and PNAMES. Of course, to do
this, you first need a complete registered DOOM.wad or DOOM2.wad, and
even then it's a real pain. Beware to keep that file for yourself ONLY.

The archive for DeuTex 3.6 contains the following files. For
illustration purposes, the diagram assumes you put DEUTEX36.ZIP
in the root directory (C:\). Directory information is embedded
in the zip file, so use the PKUNZIP -d option:

     PKUNZIP DEUTEX36.ZIP  will produce:

C:\deutex36.zip
  |_
    \DEUTEX\  deusf.exe    - DeuSF program.
              deutex.exe   - DeuTex program.

              dtexman6.txt - This manual.
              file_id.diz  - For BBS use.

              readme.txt   - Short description of DeuTex/DeuSF.

              doom.pal     - Doom palette, PaintShop Pro format.
              heretic.pal  - Heretic palette, PaintShop Pro format.

              test-me.zip  - a ZIP file containing batch files
                             to test DeuTex with Trinity.wad




You may end up moving the palettes if you want them in their native
application's directory.

WinTex, the Visual Basic shell for DeuTex, has gone so huge and
powerful that it can't be included in the deutex files anymore.
It will be available separately, as WINTEX35.ZIP.




                                                                  page 3

                       ----------------------
C)                     DIRECTORIES AND DeuTex
                       ----------------------

Chapter 5 tells you all about the directories DeuTex uses, but this
section will give you the general picture. I'm going to use an
imaginary cake making machine to explain DeuTex's directories (I know,
I know, it's stupid! <g>). To make cake with this machine, you put your
flour in one, container, raisins in another, sugar another, milk,
icing, walnuts, chocolate, eggs, etc. All your best stuff, each in it's
own place. Then you flip the switch, and the machine thumps and smokes,
and voila! Cake!

DeuTex works in the same way . You put your Map in one box, sounds in
another, textures, patches, graphics, lumps, sprites and flats all in
their own boxes. If you don't want raisins today, leave the sprites box
empty. When all is in place, flip the switch (DeuTex -make, in a batch
file preferably), DeuTex thumps and smokes for a little while, and
voila! pwad!

                            ---------------
D)                          WHAT DO I NEED?
                            ---------------

************************** User Requirements *************************

ATTENTION: DeuTex is not completely trivial to use. It requires a
           fully functional processing unit, with a least 10000 meg
           of available neurons, some basic DOS and Doom specs dynamic
           libraries and at least 1 or 2 hours of spare processing
           time at a minimum 80% attention rate. You have been warned.

SUGGESTION: If you use DeuTex, try New Wad Tool, too. The two tools
            combine very well together under DOS. (NWT is not available
            for other O/S).

************************ Hardware Requirements ***********************

This program is an ordinary DOS executable, compiled in a HUGE memory
model, with 386 instructions. It does not make use of a math
coprocessor. It should run with about 500k of free base memory, or less.
It might not run under a 286. It was tested on a Compaq LITE 4/33c and
an IBM Thinkpad 755c.

DOS/GO32, Unix, Linux, OS/2, SGiX and Alpha versions are also available.

                           -------------
E)                         WHAT DO I DO?
                           -------------

Please read this Manual before asking questions. I know it's boring, but
this IS freeware, and I have limited time to support it. Bug reports ARE
appreciated IF they come with the files you were using when the bug
occurred, and a full description of it.

Read and be familiar with all the Doom literature you can, especially
the 'unofficial' DOOM SPECS 1.6 by Matt Fell. You don't need to read the
file formats, but you need to understand what the different entries are
for, and the tricks and limitations of Doom.





                                                                  page 4




DeuTex makes some checks on your pwad, but I don't have time to program
for all possible errors.  Become familiar with the various editors you
need to create the resources used in this program. DeuTex does not edit
things. It puts the things YOU edit together. For editing, use the best
sound or Graphic editor you can afford.

When the foregoing is done, you take all your cool stuff. You put it in
DeuTex's boxes. You give DeuTex the directions on what to DO with your
stuff. You run DeuTex. That's All, Folks.




                         ------------------
F)                       WHAT IS DEUSF FOR?
                         ------------------


DeuSF is a program to help overcome some of Doom's limitations,
and still be able to distribute a reasonable sized pwad. With
sprites and flats, you have to replace EVERYTHING in order for
Doom to work right. This makes for a big pwad (3 to 5 megs), and
it's illegal to take Id's sprites or flats from Doom, put them in
your pwad, and then distribute them.

DeuSF allows you to replace as few sprites and flats as you desire,
and distribute ONLY THOSE with your pwad. With the appropriate batch
file, it will change things at the USER's site to enable your pwad to
play, without stepping on toes, or asking people to download multi-
megabyte single Level pwads!

Another advantage of DeuSF is that it makes sprite pwads playable with
either Doom or Doom2 using the same install.bat file. Isn't that great?




                     --------------------------
G)                   WHAT ARE THE PALETTES FOR?
                     --------------------------


doom.pal     (Doom palette, for PaintShop PRO 3.0 shareware program)
heretic.pal  (same, but for Heretic)


These are the color palettes used by Doom and Heretic.

If you edit or create any graphics (patches, sprites, etc.) in your
favorite graphics program, the colors will most likely be different
from the ones used in Doom. When they are inserted in a pwad, they
need to be 'quantized', which is a fancy word for color-matched.
Although this sounds simple, it can actually be quite involved. DeuTex
can quantize colors, but it's not optimised for that, so quantization
might be quite poor: there is no dithering.
Quantisation of colors is a serious job, meant to be done by specialised
programs.




                                                                  page 5




What should you do before inserting a picture with DeuTex?

* AVOID regular patterns, like squares/stripes. These patterns are prone
  to create ugly aliasing when scaled by Doom.
* SMOOTH it! I mean, apply a low pass filter so that it appears blurred.
  This will also hide some of the aliasing effects of scaling.
* QUANTIZE your colors with one of the supplied Doom palettes. DeuTex is
  optimised for the original Doom palette. If you use another palette,
  it will be slower. DeuTex will quantize your colors to the Doom colors
  using a strange alchemy. No dithering.
* TRANSPARENT areas should be made of A UNIQUE COLOR, preferably CYAN
  (r=0,g=255,b=255, but you can specify another color to DeuTex.)

  WARNING: Some lame programs don't support full 0-255 range. CYAN could
           be r=0, g=252, b=252. Experiment first.

The enclosed palettes are in the format of two good graphics programs.
Use them to quantize your pictures before you feed them to DeuTex.

doompal.pal is in the format used by PAINTSHOP PRO v2, a popular
shareware graphics program with excellent color conversion capabilities.

To convert with doompal.pal in PAINT SHOP PRO:

 -  Load the file you want to convert.
 -  Select *Colors* from the menu bar.
 -  Select *Load Palette* from the drop-down menu.
 -  Browse to find doompal.pal and select it.
 -  In the 'apply palette to image using' box, select *error diffusion*.
 -  Select *OK*.

PaintShop Pro will then quantize your image to the Doom palette.

 -  Select *File* from the menu bar.
 -  Select *Save As* from the drop-down menu.
 -  Select *BMP - OS/2 or Windows Bitmap* from 'List files of type'.
 -  Select *Windows RGB Encoded* from 'File Sub-format'.
 -  Select *OK*.

Doom will now display your Graphic pretty much as you expect.

If you want to make a .PBM (portable bitmap), use ppmquant on your
picture, with doompal.ppm as the reference for colors.

 Alternatively, if you extract a Doom Graphic with DeuTex, it will
 contain the Doom palette. You can then feed it to your favorite
 program, and let it extract the palette for later reuse.

 WARNING:
 Experiment with this first, as your program might not do what you
 expect it to. For example ZSoft's PC Paintbrush will load the Doom
 Graphic correctly and allow you to save the palette. However, if you
 take a 24 bit image and load the palette, nothing will happen. You can
 let PC Paintbrush convert the image to 256 colors (which it will do
 poorly), and then apply the palette. The results will be grotesque,
 because it doesn't quantize when applying a palette. A Doom palette
 saved in this program would be useful only for Graphics you want to
 hand-draw from scratch. The moral is, if you don't know what you're
 doing, experiment first before using a Graphic you don't want to lose.


                                                                  page 6



CHAPTER 2

*************** TEST-ME or What's inside TRINITY.wad? *****************

                             -------------
A)                           About TEST-ME
                             -------------

    TRINITY.BAT let's you have a quick overview of some of the
    capabilities of DeuTex so you can decide if it's worth the trouble.

TRINITY.BAT does the following:

    It lists the contents of TRINITY.wad (with identifications).
    It decomposes TRINITY.wad and builds TRINIDAD.wad.
    All this in only 3 trivial DeuTex commands.

Requirements:

-  You must have TRINITY.wad, the great pwad by Steve McCrea.
   (available on ftp.cdrom.com as TRINITY2.ZIP and
   in the Compuserve GAMERS FORUM LIB 8 as TRINTY.ZIP)
-  Doom must be in the \DOOM directory (\DOOM2 could work too)
-  TRINITY.wad must be in the current directory.
-  You must have *some* room left on your disk :-)
-  You must be running DOS 5.0 or higher.
-  You must NOT reuse any part TRINITY.wad without crediting Steve.

Description of the file, TRINITY.BAT:

                        ----------------------
B)                      Listing the directory
                        ----------------------

      rem     ***DeuTex***
      deutex  -doom \doom     -wadir TRINITY.wad
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  (a)                (b)

(a)---> This tells DeuTex that DOOM.wad and DOOM.EXE are in the
        \DOOM directory. OPTIONAL.
(b)---> This tells DeuTex to list the directory of TRINITY.wad
        reporting the entry types. Types *could* be wrong, but not
        with Trinity.

                        ------------------------
C)                      Decomposing TRINITY.wad:
                        ------------------------

      rem     ***DeuTex***
      deutex  -doom \DOOM    -dir .    -xtract TRINITY.wad
              ^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  (a)         (b)               (c)

(a)---> The same as before.
(b)---> This tells DeuTex that it must store the result in '.' (which is
        the current directory).  You could skip (b), since '.' is the
        default, or you could specify another directory, like -dir TEST.
(c)---> This tells DeuTex to extract all entries from TRINITY.wad.



                                                                  page 7




                ----------------------------------------
D)              Recomposing TRINITY.wad as TRINIDAD.wad:
                ----------------------------------------

      rem    ***DeuTex****
      deutex  -doom \doom   -dir .   -make wadINFO.TXT TRINIDAD.wad
              ^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  (a)        (b)            (c)            (d)

(a)--->  The same as before.
(b)--->  The same as before.
(c)--->  This tells DeuTex to create a new pwad, from the
         creation directives contained in wadINFO.TXT.
(d)--->  This is the name of the created pwad.


                        ------------------------
 E)                     Customizing TRINITY.wad:
                        ------------------------

    You can edit wadINFO.TXT, the format is pretty simple to guess.
   (see Chapter 8 - FORMATS for a precise definition.)

-  A line that begins with a ';' or '#' is a comment. DeuTex ignores it.
-  Don't touch any lines with [xxxx] (they are section delimiters).

+ Lets look at the [MUSICS] section:

+   [MUSICS]
    D_E1M1

+   This tells DeuTex to go into the \MUSICS subdirectory and get a file
    called D_E1M1.MUS, which is the music of TRINITY.wad. You might
    wish to delete this D_E1M1 if your sound card crashes while playing
    trinity.

    You can add your own music, for Episode 1 Mission 2 by editing:

+       [MUSICS]
        D_E1M1
        D_E1M2

    Of course, the file D_E1M2.MUS must exist... You can generate it
    from D_E1M2.MID (MIDI format) by using MIDI2MUS.



BEWARE: DeuTex is NOT fool proof yet. It should not crash your
        computer, but the generated pwad may crash Doom if you make
        mistakes. I'm very sorry for this, but I have more urgent
        optimizations to do than foolproofing. However, the pwad
        generated here should not crash Doom, if you use the real
        TRINITY.wad as a basis.








                                                                  page 8




CHAPTER 3
************************** WORKING WITH wads **************************

                              ------------
A)                            INTRODUCTION
                              ------------

Read the DOOM SPECS:
Sorry. This is still unavoidable, because of the various tricks and
limits of Doom. If you have a problem, there is a VERY GOOD chance
it's referred to somewhere in Matt Fell's SPECS.

NOTE: In the following discussion, avoid these common mistakes:

Hall of Mirrors with new Textures:

         First, create your Level.
         Then, build the nodes and reject.
         Then add the new Textures.

Why? We don't know.  leonardc@halcyon.com reported he saw a hall of
mirrors with old versions of DeuTex that didn't first load the old Doom
Textures. It seems to be a problem with the node builders.

Tutti Frutti and Medusa Effect:

See the DOOM specs, and Chapter 8 - FORMATS.
If Doom attempts to display part of a Texture not covered by a patch,
you'll see some ugly garbage (usually has pinks and greens, thus 'Tutti
Frutti'). The same thing happens if you use more than one patch on a
Texture with transparent areas, or walls with see-thru portions on upper
or lower Textures. If the area is big enough, it will slow the display
to a crawl ('Medusa Effect' - Looks like snakes and turns you to stone).

Doom reports a void column and exits:

One of your Textures has a column with no patches. Use DeuTex -check on
a pwad before running Doom. It reports Textures that have void columns.

 Other bugs:

   Mail me a description of the bug, together with any configuration
   files. Don't expect a quick answer, though.

                        -----------------------
B)                      How to decompose a pwad
                        -----------------------

First check that all the entries are identified correctly:

  DEUTEX -wadir NEWBIE.wad    This will list the directory.

Then try:

  DEUTEX -unused NEWBIE.wad   This will tell you if there is any wasted
                              data in the pwad. It's always funny to see
                              how DMGRAPH and DMAUD waste *some* data.
                              This won't tell you about any data wasted
                              by incorrect entry formats, though.


                                                                  page 9


To extract entries in the pwad:
+
+DEUTEX -get SPOSA1 DOOM.wad   Extract the entry SPOSA1 from DOOM.wad
+
 DEUTEX -xtract NEWBIE.wad     Extract all the entries in NEWBIE.wad.
                              A directory structure is created, and the
                              entries are put in the subdirectories.
                              A file wadINFO.TXT is created, to describe
                              the contents of the pwad.

 DEUTEX -sound -xtract NEWBIE.wad  Only the sounds are extracted and
                                  placed in the \SOUNDS subdirectory,
                                  which is created if it doesn't exist.

NOTE: Some obsolete pwad tools used to declare patches, Flats and sprites
      without the normal markers. DeuTex attempts to compensate, but
      it could be that some entries will be identified incorrectly.
      DeuTex will then consider them as LUMPS or as GRAPHICS. So if you
      don't find a sprite in .\SPRITES\, look in .\GRAPHICS\.
      You will then have to declare them in the [SPRITES] section again.


Once you have decomposed a pwad, you can rebuild it with:

DEUTEX -make wadINFO.TXT NEWBIE.wad

wadINFO.TXT already exists, because it was automatically created during
the extraction of NEWBIE.wad (cool, no?). Make sure you delete or move
the previous version of NEWBIE.wad before you remake it, because DeuTex
will not overwrite your files (you might not like it :-]).

NOTE: DEUTEX puts a signature in the first few bytes of a created pwad,
      to identify which version of DEUTEX was used.


                 --------------------------------------
C)               How to create a pwad with new Textures
                 --------------------------------------

 First list Doom's Textures, as a reference:

 DEUTEX -texture -extract

 This will extract all the Textures from the main iwad. They will be
 written to TEXTURE1.TXT (and TEXTURE2.TXT for Doom1 only). These text
 files will be placed in the subdirectory \TEXTURES, which will be
 created if it doesn't exist. These files make it easy for you to
 redefine existing Textures by cutting them out and pasting them into
 YOUR Texture definition file. Note that it's not wise to redefine
 textures from Doom or Doom, except if you're redefining an animation.

 When you will wish to define new textures, you will put those textures
 in a texture file, which is no more than a specially formatted text file
 (no, it's not a picture) that you will put in .\TEXTURES, and that
 you will declare in the [TEXTURE1] section of wadINFO.TXT.
 This Texture file need not contain all the textures in Doom, only those
 that you wish to redefine. It's a bad idea to keep all the textures
 from Doom in your texture file. Let DeuTex handle that.

 There can be more than one texture file, which is convenient if you
 have already created textures for another wad and wish to import them.


                                                                    page 10

 Note that if you define a texture more than once, only the last
 version read by deutex will be put in the wad.
 Not also that if you define a texture that has the same name as
 a texture



 NOTE: For DOOM1/Heretic only, use one file for redefined Textures
       from OLDTEX1.TXT, and another file for redefined Textures
       from OLDTEX2.TXT. Since DeuTex v3.3, wadINFO.TXT uses a second
       Texture section called [TEXTURE2] for redefined OLDTEX2 files.


 DeuTex 3.3 doesn't care if OLDTEX1.TXT or OLDTEX2.TXT exist.
 DeuTex 2.x used to require that all the old textures be present,
 but now DeuTex 3.3 first read the internal Doom texture definitions,
 then reads the file you tell it to read, for new definitions.
 If you mistakenly define the same Texture in multiple files,
 only the last declared version will be used. Of course, that means
 that if you redefine a Doom texture your version will be used.

Declare TEXTURE1 in the [TEXTURE1] section of wadINFO.TXT.
Then build your pwad:

DEUTEX -make wadINFO.TXT NEWBIE.wad

At this point, it would be a good idea to
check your new pwad for Texture errors:

DEUTEX -check NEWBIE.wad


            -----------------------------------------------
D)          How to create a pwad with new sprites and Flats
            -----------------------------------------------

******** 1) Sprite and flat replacement

BEWARE: Sprite replacement is tricky. If some needed sprites are
  missing Doom will lock up. Check your work often.

Put your sprite files in \SPRITES in .GIF or .BMP format.
Put your Flat files in \FLATS in .GIF or .BMP format.
Declare your sprite NAMES in the [SPRITES] section of wadINFO.TXT.
Declare your Flat NAMES in the [FLATS] section of wadINFO.TXT.
Use only the NAME in wadINFO.TXT, without the .GIF or .BMP extension.

 Since DeuTex 3.1:
 The '=' label lets your sprites keep the names YOU have given
 them. It tells wadINFO.TXT what Doom sprite you mean to replace.
 This enables you to name your sprite files as you damn wish.

If you want to replace *ALL* of the sprites and Flats in Doom (crazy):

DEUTEX -iwad -make wadINFO.TXT NEWBIE.wad

NEWBIE.wad will be directly usable by Doom.

Remember: replacing only part of the sprites and Flats mean you'll
need DeuSF to install your pwad, but it will be compatible with ALL
versions of Doom and Doom2. Redefining all the sprites is not a good
idea unless you really mean it.


                                                                  page 11




To replace *SOME* of the sprites and/or Flats in Doom (better):

DEUTEX -make wadINFO.TXT NEWBIE.wad

This NEWBIE.wad will be much smaller and easier to distribute.
BUT: This NEWBIE.wad will cause Doom to lock up when it starts!(bad)

    So, if you want to replace only *SOME* of the sprites and Flats in
    Doom, you have 3 choices:

DEUTEX -merge NEWBIE.wad           Modifies DOOM.wad or DOOM2.wad.
                                  (Safe, fast, and small)

DEUSF  -append NEWBIE.wad          Modifies NEWBIE.wad.
                                  (Safer, still fast, wastes some space)

DEUSF -add NEWBIE.wad NEWBIE2.wad  Creates NEWBIE2.wad.
                                  (Safest, not slow, more space wasted)
+
+ NEW! To merge two pwads that both redefine sprites and/or Flats:
+
+ DEUSF -join FIRST.wad SECOND.wad  (FIRST.wad now contains both wads)


NOTE: The steps above are performed at the end users' site, preferably
      from a batch file supplied with your pwad. This means the user
      must have DeuSF, which can be distributed freely with your pwad,
      or DeuTex, which has some restrictions on distribution. See the
      License Agreement at the end of this manual for the restrictions
      on distributing DeuTex.

The -sprite command is used to add only sprites, ignoring the Flats:

DEUSF -sprite -app NEWBIE.wad

The -flat command is used to add only Flats, without the sprites:

DEUSF -flat -add NEWBIE.wad NEWBIE2.wad


 ******** 2) HOW to ADD or REMOVE SPRITE VIEWPOINTS

 DeuTex allows you to alter the number of viewpoints a sprite displays
 in your pwad. DOOM.EXE predetermines the 'behavior' of a given sprite
 name, but it doesn't predetermine the number of viewpoints. A sprite
 MUST, however, always have either ONE viewpoint or EIGHT viewpoints.
 Viewpoints are numbered as follows:

                                Front

                                  1
                            2     |     8
                             \____|____/
                             |         |
                        3 -- | SPRITE  | -- 7
                             |_________|
                            /     |    \
                           4      |     6
                                  5


                                                                  page 12




 The FULL NAME of the sprite determines the viewpoint of that sprite:

                             BAR1A2.bmp
                             \  /| \________________
                              \/ |                  \
              ________________/  |  The last number is the viewpoint. A
             /                   |  zero here means the sprite has only
 The first four letters are the  |  one viewpoint. If not zero, there
 sprite name as recognized by    |  MUST be 8 files for each 'frame' of
 DOOM.EXE. They are the same for |  the Sprite.
 all entries of a given Sprite.  |
                                 |
          This is the 'frame' number of the Sprite. Animated
          Sprites will have consecutive letters here for each
          frame (A is frame one, B is frame two, etc.). DOOM.EXE
          predetermines how many frames a Sprite uses, so you can
          not animate an electrical column, for instance.

 Sometimes, you will see a Sprite entry that has 2 viewpoints in one
 Sprite, like BOSSA2A8. This means that the same Graphic is used for
 viewpoints A2 and A8 (front-left and front-right). When Doom sees
 this, it uses the Graphic as is for A2, and mirrors it for A8.

 In the above example BAR1 is the Barrel Sprite. Doom does a 2 frame
 animation on barrels (the slime flickers), so the whole entry is:

      BAR1A0
      BAR1B0

 This disregards the explosion (BEXP) Sprite
 that is used when you shoot a Barrel.

 If you want to change the Barrel Sprite to an 8 viewpoint
 Sprite, you will need to create 16 Graphics:

       BAR1A1
       BAR1B1
       BAR1A2
       BAR1B2
       BAR1A3
       BAR1B3
       BAR1A4
       BAR1B4
       BAR1A5
       BAR1B5
       BAR1A6
       BAR1B6
       BAR1A7
       BAR1B7
       BAR1A8
       BAR1B8

 This gives you 8 viewpoints for EACH frame of the animation. If you
 only replaced BAR1A1 thru 8, you would see your new Graphic flash to a
 barrel a couple of times a second, because you didn't replace the 2nd
 frame. If you add a 3rd frame (BAR1C1 etc.), it will be ignored by
 Doom because DOOM.EXE already knows a barrel has only 2 frames.




                                                                  page 13




 Alternatively, you could take an Imp and give it only 1 viewpoint by
 taking only one of the views for each animation frame and naming it
 TROOA0.bmp (with the correct letter for the frame you're using). The
 Sprite will look kind of funny moving around, since it will only face
 one direction the whole time.

+ Special Sprites replacements:
+
+ Some of you like to define their own sprites names, via a dehacked
+ patch. This trick is useful, because if you use custom sprite names
+ in your pwad, then it need not be completed by all the sprites from
+ the iwad. However, it will need a S_END appended at the end, otherwise
+ the game will not work.
+ So use the switch -s_end when you build your sprite wad with DeuTex.
+ Example:   deutex -s_end -make myweapons.wad


                  ----------------------------------
 E)               How to create pwad with new sounds
                  ----------------------------------

First put your sound files in the .\SOUNDS directory.
Then, declare the sound NAMES in the [SOUNDS] section of wadINFO.TXT.
See APPENDIX IV for a listing of the sound names recognized by Doom.
Then build your pwad:

DEUTEX -make wadINFO.TXT NEWBIE.wad

Sound effects: [DSxxxxxx.WAV or DSxxxxxx.AU]

  Supported formats are WAV, AU (Sun Audio) and VOC.
  Use only the 8 bits per sample, non-compressed, mono sounds.
  Do not use Stereo, 16 bit sounds or ADPCM  compression.

PC speaker sounds: [DPxxxxxx.TXT]

  Text files containing a list of numbers from 1-255.



Musics are different from sound files. They describe only the
notes to be played. They can't be obtained from normal sounds.
There is one music defined for each level of Doom or Heretic.
It has a special name, that is related to the level name (except
in Doom2)
Musics are declared in the [MUSICS] section, and placed in the
.\MUSICS directory.

Music: [D_xxxxxx.MUS]

  They must be in MUS format. You can convert MIDI files to MUS files
  by using MIDI2MUS.EXE (thanks to -dtt-> of Id software).

  You can get a list of musics by typing:
  deutex -musics -wadir
  This will help you guess the names of the musics.





                                                                  page 14



CHAPTER 4

************************** Visual Basic Shell **************************

                 -------------------------------------
                                WinTex
                      The MS Windows shell for DeuTex.
                              version 3.41
                 -------------------------------------





WinTex 3.41 is a tool designed to make DeuTex real easy to use.
It runs under Windows, and is written in C and Visual Basic.

WinTex will prepare the data that DeuTex will compile into a wad.
It's real easy to figure out, once you know how deutex works, and
     it will do for you all the stuff that deutex can't help you do
     (like adjusting the sprites offsets, composing the textures).

With WinTex, you can use your own level editor, sound editor, music
editor, picture editor, text editor, node builder, reject builder,
and rely on good old DeuTex to make the tedious job of wad
composition and wad merging.

Actually, the windows part is only for the presentation, not for the real
work. Windows is too unsafe to do any serious job...

WinTex is the best way to use DeuTex, provided you have Windows 3.1.
(WinTex is a 16-bit application, to spare you compatibility troubles)

You will need VBRUN300.DLL in your windows/system directory, of course,
as this is a Visual Basic application. The other DLL and VBX are
provided with WinTex.


























                                                                  page 15

                *** [PART TWO]   DETAILS, DETAILS ***
                    -----------------------------


CHAPTER 5

************************* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE *************************

DeuTex uses the following directory structure to store Doom entries.
First create a directory (call it MYwadIR or whatever) for your pwad.
Make sure DeuTex is on your path, or put a copy of it in MYwadIR. Put
a copy of the pwad you are working on (MYwad.wad) in MYwadIR.

Type:        DeuTex -xtract mywad.wad

DeuTex will automatically create the appropriate subdirectories and put
all the wad's entries in the proper place. It will also create a file
named wadINFO.TXT in MYwadIR. If your pwad is a bare map Level with no
additions yet, you should get something like:

            \MYwadIR\--------mywad.wad
                    |        wadinfo.txt
                    |        DeuTex.exe (optional, if not on your path)
                    |_
                      \LEVELS\------EnMm.wad

Note that DeuTex will not OVERWRITE any existing files. In the example
above, if you type DeuTex -xtract AGAIN, you will get an error message
telling you the files already exist. You have to delete wadinfo.txt and
EnMm.wad (or move them somewhere else) for xtract to work again. If you
lose something you wanted to keep, don't blame DeuTex, it's innocent!

 Now type :   DeuTex <-doom doom directory> -textures -extract

DeuTex will read the Textures from Doom.wad or DOOM2.wad, list them in
a file called TEXTURE1.TXT (and TEXTURE2.TXT for DOOM 1) and store them
in a directory called \TEXTURES, which it will create if it doesn't
exist.

NOTE: The <-doom doom directory> command is optional. Take a look at
      Chapter 6 - DEUTEX COMMANDS for a more complete description of
      when you should use it.

Your working directory should now look like this:

              \MYwadIR\-----mywad.wad
                      |     wadinfo.txt
                      |     DeuTex (optional)
                      |_
                      | \LEVELS\----EnMm.wad
                      |_
                        \TEXTURES\---texture1.txt
                                     texture2.txt

If your pwad had any other resources (Sprites, Flats, sounds, etc.) in
it and you used DeuTex -xtract, it would extract those resources, too.
Then it would create the proper directory and store them in it.



                                                                  page 16




If you want to add something to your pwad, put it in the proper
subdirectory (create it if it's not there), and tell wadinfo.txt about
it. Chapter 8 - FORMATS describes wadinfo.txt in detail.

Then type: DeuTex -make wadinfo.txt mywad.wad

DeuTex will read wadinfo.txt and go get all the resources it asks for
from the directories. Then it will create mywad.wad from them. Note
that if you create a pwad from the above example, it  won't be any
different than what you started out with! You need to put some
ingredients into the mix before you see any results. THAT's what the
other directories are for.

Again note that DeuTex won't overwrite mywad.wad if it exists. Since
most of the stuff you'll do with DeuTex will be from a batch file, have
it handle your housekeeping whatever way you like. Something like the
following works pretty well:

        del mywad.wad
        DeuTex -make wadinfo.txt mywad.wad
        copy C:\DOOM\wads\mywad.wad mywad.bak
        copy mywad.wad C:\DOOM\wads\mywad.wad

This way, if you find out you've really screwed things up when you test
your pwad, there's always a copy of the previous version to use.

DEUTEX SUBDIRECTORIES:

                              --------

'Bare' pwads go here! A bare pwad is one that you have edited and
constructed the nodes, reject, and blockmap. The pwad will then
contain only the following 11 entries in IT'S directory: EnMm(MAPnm),
THINGS, LINEDEFS, SIDEDEFS, VERTEXES, SEGS, SSECTORS, NODES, SECTORS,
REJECT, and BLOCKMAP.

BEWARE: BLOCKMAP REJECT SSECTOR SEGS are not optional! they must have
        been generated by your Level editor (along with BSP, IDBSP,
        REJECT, RMB, whatever).

 THE FILES PUT HERE MUST BE DECLARED IN THE [LEVELS] SECTION OF
 wadINFO.TXT. ALL FILES MUST BE IN THE FORM EnMm.wad OR MAPnm.wad OR
 EQUATED TO EnMm or MAPnm in wadINFO.TXT.

 Suppose you have edited two Levels named PLAGUE.wad and E3M4.wad. You
 want the combined pwad to replace E1M2 and E3M4 in DOOM.wad. You would
 edit the [LEVELS] section of wadINFO.TXT to read:

 [LEVELS]
 E1M2 =PLAGUE
 E3M4

 This tells DeuTex to look in the LEVELS\ subdirectory for PLAGUE.wad
 and E3M4.wad and to combine them in the final pwad as E1M2 and E3M4.

                               -------

Lumps are raw data for Doom with the extension .LMP. If you have
edited or created any of them for your pwad, put them here. The
following files are the LMPs used by Doom. You can insert something
else if you like, and Doom will ignore it. It's a mystery why anyone
would do this, but wad builders are a mysterious bunch!

*********************** Lumps recognized by Doom **********************

PLAYPAL.LMP   Color PALETTES (14 of them consisting of 256 RGB triplets
              each - 768 bytes/palette). The first one contains the
              normal Doom colors. The others temporarily 'tint' the
              screen colors for different events in Doom. (Item pickup,
              Hurt and Berserk Reds, Radsuit Green etc...)

COLORMAP.LMP  Color MAPS.  There are 34 of these,consisting of
              256 bytes each. These are NOT RGB triplets. They map
              whatever PLAYPAL currently being displayed by Doom to
              darker colors corresponding to the light level in a
              sector. These mapped colors are what you see on the
              screen.  The first map (map 0) corresponds to a light
              level of 247-255, and doesn't change the display at all.
              The 32nd map (map 31) corresponds to a light level of 0-7
              and maps almost all colors to the darkest one in the
              presently use PLAYPAL. Map 32 makes everything black and
              white for 'invulnerability'. Map 33 is all zeros.

ENDOOM.LMP    Text displayed when leaving Doom. Use A program
              like TED or ENDOOMER to edit this text.
              (DO NOT REMOVE THE ID COPYRIGHT!)

DEMO1.LMP   / Demos recorded by Doom.
DEMO2.LMP  <  e.g. DOOM -record DEMO2 -file MYwad.wad
DEMO3.LMP   \ Then move DEMO2.LMP here, and that's all!

DMXGUS.LMP    (DOOM1)    / Text file remapping MIDI instruments
DMXGUSC.LMP   (DOOM2) \ for the Gravis Ultra Sound card.

GENMIDI       Instrument mapping for GENMIDI compatible cards.

***********************************************************************

Suppose you have edited ENDOOM.LMP and recorded a new DEMO1.LMP  for
your pwad. Just put copies of them here, and declare them in the [LUMPS]
section of wadINFO.TXT like this:

     [LUMPS]
     ENDOOM
     DEMO1

           This tells DeuTex to look here for ENDOOM.LMP and DEMO1.LMP

***********************************************************************

+ To replace the Heretic TITLE screens, put a 320x200 picture in the LUMPS
+ subdirectory and declare it as you would declare a TITLE lump.
+ DeuTex will know that it must convert it to the special RAW format.

                                                                  page 18




                             ----------
 C)                           \TEXTURES
                             ----------

 NOTE: DOOM1/Heretic contains 2 Texture entries, TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2.
     this is because of differences between the shareware and registered
     versions. If you are using DeuTex with Doom2, just ignore any
     references to TEXTURE2. It doesn't exist in DOOM2.wad.

 This subdirectory contains a text file(s) describing the Texture
 changes you want in your pwad (Chapter 8 describes Texture definition
 files). Your file can be given any name you want (prefer TEXTURE1.TXT
 or TEXTURE2.TXT). This name (without extension) is then entered in the
 [TEXTURE1] section of wadINFO.TXT.

 FILES PUT HERE HAVE THE EXTENSION (.TXT). THE TITLE OF ANY FILE PUT
 HERE MUST BE DECLARED IN THE [TEXTURE1] SECTION OF wadINFO.TXT.

 The file names OLDTEX1.TXT and OLDTEX2.TXT are reserved. Due to an
 amazing bug (in Doom?), if Doom's Texture list contains any new or
 redefined Textures before all the UNCHANGED Textures are listed, it
 produces HOM (Hall of Mirrors) errors. Previous versions of DeuTex
 dealt with this problem by requiring a copy of TEXTURE1.TXT (with any
 redefined Textures deleted) here in the \TEXTURES subdirectory. This
 is no longer necessary with version 3.3. DeuTex now reads the original
 TEXTURE1 from the main iwad while creating your pwad. It then reads
 your new Textures and automatically sorts , deletes, and combines all
 entries. Olivier's too good to you guys >;-]

 EXAMPLES:

 If you want to add ONLY new Textures:

    - Put your definition file here (e.g. TEXTURE1.TXT), and declare
      TEXTURE1 in the [TEXTURE1] section of (wadINFO.TXT).

 If you want to redefine Textures in TEXTURE1:

    - Run DeuTex -dmtextures to get the Textures.
    - Cut the Textures to be redefined from OLDTEX1.TXT and paste
      them into TEXTURE1.TXT. Edit them or change them as you wish.
    - You can delete OLDTEX2.TXT and OLDTEX1.TXT now if you want.
    - Declare TEXTURE1 in the [TEXTURE1] section of wadINFO.TXT.

 If you want to redefine Textures in TEXTURE2:

     - Run DeuTex -dmtextures to get the Textures.
     - Cut the Textures to redefine out of OLDTEX2.TXT and put
       them in TEXTURE2.TXT. Edit and change them as you wish.
     - You can delete OLDTEX1.TXT and OLDTEX2.TXT now if you want.
     - Declare TEXTURE2 in the [TEXTURE2] section of wadINFO.TXT.

APPENDICES I and II contain lists of the animated and switch Textures
from DOOM.wad (Not the new ones from DOOM2, sorry. Use DeuTex to make
your own list). Copy the portion you want to edit into TEXTURE1.TXT.
It's a little easier than hunting through the entire OLDTEX1.TXT files.
Beware: some textures change a lot, between Doom and Doom2.




                                                                  page 19

D)                             \SOUNDS and \MUSICS
                              --------------------

+ Put your new sound files here in the correct format. They must have
+ the same name as the sound you want to replace (Appendix IV lists the
+ Sound names used in Doom1 and Doom2. It also lists the sound names for
+ each DMAUD sound number). Put the sound NAME (no extension) in the
+ [SOUNDS] section of wadINFO.TXT.

DeuTex uses the following formats for Doom sound files:

MUSIC:                      (D_xxxxxx.MUS)    for Doom/Doom2
                            (MUS_xxxx.MUS)    for Heretic
MUS format (RAW format, which can be created from MIDI
files with MIDI2MUS.EXE, provided by ddt).

SOUNDCARD SOUND EFFECTS:    (DSxxxxxx.WAV)    for Doom/Doom2
                            (xxxxxxx.wav)     for Heretic
Windows WAVE file (.WAV). Use a converter if you prefer .AU.
Preferably use 11025 sample/second for your recording.
VOC format is supported only for 11025 sample/s (DeuTex can't convert).

PC-SPEAKER:                  (DPxxxxxx.TXT)   only for Doom
Text files (.TXT) with numbers 0-255

WARNING: DeuTex assumes that any file name beginning with:
                     'D_' or 'MUS_' is music.
                     'DS'           is sound card sound effect.
                     'DP'           is PC speaker sound effect.
+ Suppose you've created new music for Level E1M5 called D_E1M5.MUS. You
+ also want to replace DSSHOTGN with a your file called PTOOEY.WAV. You
+ would put the files here and edit your wadINFO.TXT as follows:
+
+      [MUSICS]
+      D_E1M5
+      [SOUNDS]
+      DSSHOTGN =PTOOEY
+
+         This tells DeuTex to look here for D_E1M5.MUS and PTOOEY.WAV.
+         It will replace the sound DSSHOTGN with PTOOEY.WAV

                             ----------
E)                            \GRAPHICS
                             ----------

For Doom pictures other than Sprites, Flats or Textures. Put the
changed Graphic FILE here in .BMP or .GIF format, and enter the NAME
(without extension) in the [GRAPHICS] section of wadINFO.TXT.

Suppose you have created a new TITLEPIC.BMP, and want SURRENDR.BMP to
replace VICTORY2. Just put the files here and declare them in the
[GRAPHICS] part of wadINFO.TXT, like:

    [GRAPHICS]
    TITLEPIC
    VICTORY2 = SURRENDR

     DeuTex will look here for TITLEPIC.BMP and SURRENDR.BMP (or .GIF).
     It will use SURRENDR.BMP for VICTORY2.

                                                                  page 20

F)                             \SPRITES
                              ---------

Put your new Sprites here in (.BMP) or (.GIF) format.

WARNING: DOOM WILL LOCK UP IF YOU ATTEMPT TO REPLACE ONLY SOME OF THE
         EXISTING SPRITES! Either replace all the Sprites with DEUTEX
         -iwad -make or replace only some of the Sprites and use DEUSF
         -add, DEUSF -append or DEUTEX -merge.

 Suppose you want to redefine SPOSA1 and TROOB2. You want to replace
 them with SPOSA1.GIF and LIZARD.BMP. Put the files here, and then
 declare them in the [SPRITES] section of wadINFO.TXT, like:

      [SPRITES]
      SPOSA1
      TROOB2 =LIZARD

      DeuTex will look here for SPOSA1.BMP (or .GIF) and LIZARD.BMP.

                               -------
G)                              \FLATS
                               -------

For new floors and ceilings as 64x64 (.BMP) or (.GIF) files.

WARNING: TO USE YOUR NEW FLATS, YOU MUST MERGE YOUR pwad WITH THE MAIN
         iwad, OR USE DEUSF TO PUT ALL THE iwad FLATS INTO YOUR pwad.

Sorry, but this is a limitation of Doom, not of DeuTex. Flats inserted
here will not crash Doom when the pwad is run because I don't use the
regular F_START F_END delimiters that confuse Doom. Your pwad *WILL*
fail when it references those Flats, so heed the warning above.

 Suppose you want MUDDY.BMP as a new Flat, and HATCH.GIF to replace
 FLOOR1_7. Put the FILES here, and declare them in wadINFO.TXT, like:

      [FLATS]
      MUDDY
      FLOOR1_7 =HATCH

 DeuTex will look here for MUDDY.BMP and HATCH.BMP (Then HATCH.GIF),
 and replace FLOOR1_7 with HATCH.GIF. BUT, SEE WARNING ABOVE!


                                                                  page 21


                              ---------
H)                             \PATCHES
                              ---------

The patches are the pictures that compose the textures. These
pictures are often used for more than one texture.
+ Since DeuTex 3.6:
+  The patches are handled pretty much like Graphics, except that
+  they are to be declared in the [PATCHES] section, and the
+  corresponding picture put in the .\PATCHES subdirectory.
+
+ Older versions of DeuTex didn't require you to declare your patches,
+ they were loaded automatically if required, but this could lead to
+ confusion. Now, if you want to replace an existing patch, you must
+ declare it explicitly.
+ DeuTex can guess the patches you need when it reads the textures
+ definitions. For compatibility with older versions, DeuTex will attempt
+ to load a patch from .\PATCHES if it detects that this patch is used.

For every new patch that is used in the texture definitions, there
must be a corresponding entry in the [PATCHES] section, and a
corresponding picture file in the .\PATCHES subdirectory.

EXAMPLE:

Suppose you want to create a new Texture called MYDOOR, which contains
two new patches called WOODEN0 and KNOB0, and a modified WARNA0 patch.
The new Texture also contains the existing EXIT1 patch.

FIRST: Put WOODEN0.BMP, KNOB0.GIF, and WARNA0.BMP here.

THEN: Define your new Texture in TEXTURE1.TXT as shown below:

      MYDOOR                256   128   ; a 256x128 wall with ...
      *     WOODEN0           0     0   ; a 256x128 background
      *     KNOB0            64   100   ; and a small knob at (64,100)
      *     WARNA0          128    12   ; a lite at top/center
      *     EXIT1           128    32   ; the word exit in the center

THEN: Put TEXTURE1.TXT in the \TEXTURES subdirectory.

THEN: Tell wadINFO.TXT that TEXTURE1.TXT is the file containing new or
      modified Textures by declaring it in the [TEXTURE1] section:

   [TEXTURE1]
   TEXTURE1

THEN: Declare your new patches

   [PATCHES]
   KNOB0
   WOODEN0
   WARNA0

DeuTex will read TEXTURE1.TXT from \TEXTURES. TEXTURE1.TXT tells DeuTex
that a new texture called MYDOOR is 256 pixels wide, and 128 pixels high.
The asterisks tell DeuTex to look here for the patches WOODEN0.BMP,
KNOB0.BMP, WARNA0.BMP and EXIT1.BMP. The numbers tell it where the
patches go on MYDOOR. Note that WOODEN0 had better be 256x128 or bigger,
or there will be at least one void column, and Doom will complain and
stop. If an existing patch is called for, and no entry by that name
exists here, the old patch will be used.

                                                                  page 22

A)                    COMPLETE COMMAND REFERENCE
                      --------------------------

Actually it's not complete, but those commands not mentioned here
are for the Visual Basic Shell, and you'll never use them. Commands
with an '*' are not implemented in the VB version. I forgot them.
All optional commands must appear before non-optional ones or else
they will be ignored. The Command Line Format is:
  DEUTEX <-optional cmd.> ,..., <-non-optional cmd.>,...,etc.

+ Note: since DeuTex 3.5, upper case commands are accepted.
+ You will generally need to type only the first 3 letter of a command.

                             -------------
B)                           HELP COMMANDS
                             -------------

  -help*   This one won't help you a lot, but it
           will give you the parameters.

  -syntax* Prints a short listing of the format of wad creation
           directives (wadinfo.txt). See the FORMATS Chapter in
           this manual for a more complete explanation.

                          -----------------
C)                        OPTIONAL COMMANDS
                          -----------------

  -doom <doom directory>

            Use this command to indicate the directory containing
            DOOM.wad and DOOM.EXE or DOOM2.wad and DOOM2.EXE.

            If this command is not used, DeuTex looks first in the
            current directory for Doom. Then it looks in the current
            directory for DOOM2. Then it looks in the root directory of
            the current drive for a directory called Doom, and finally
            looks in the root directory of the current drive for a
            directory called Doom2. The first Doom it finds is used.

            EXAMPLE:    DEUTEX -doom C:\GAMES\DOOM

  -dir <working directory>

            DEFAULT IS: CURRENT DIRECTORY. This defines the working
            directory, into which you or DeuTex will put the wad
            creation directives (wadINFO.TXT). All subdirectories
            containing pwad parts will branch from here. The completely
            assembled pwad will also reside here.

  -deu*     Use this if you want DeuTex to add 64K of junk at the end
            of your pwad. Why? To compensate for a bug in DEU 5.21,
            that makes it sometimes crash when viewing pictures.
            That bug is corrected in DEU 5.3.


                                                                  page 23




  -rgb <R> <G> <B>

           Let's you pick what *exact* color DeuTex will use for Doom's
           transparent color. The default is CYAN(R=0, G=255, B=255).

           EXPLANATION:
           Doom allows transparent areas in textures. Although there
           are 256 colors in the Doom palette, only 255 of them act
           as colors. Color number 247 (CYAN R=0 G=255 B=255) is used
           by Doom as a 'switch' to make that pixel invisible.

           When DeuTex imports your new graphics into a pwad, it must
           assign each pixel one of the Doom colors. For most of the
           16 million colors possible in an RGB format such as .BMP
           and .GIF, it is just a matter of finding the most
	   appropriate colors in the Doom palette to map to your
	   graphic. However, CYAN is more of a 'switch' than a color.
	   It wouldn't be appropriate for DeuTex to say "anything CLOSE
	   to CYAN is transparent". That would be like saying "anything
	   close to linedef type 39 is a teleport". Transparency is a
	   switch, and has to be exact.

           Some graphics programs may not be able to meet this
           requirement. For example, some programs limit you to 64 (0-63)
           increments each in Red, Green and Blue. They multiply the
           result by 4 to get the true RGB value. This is fine for most
           purposes, but not for Doom.

           In any such program, the closest you can get to CYAN is,
           0 for Red, 63 for Blue and 63 for Green. When multiplied
           to  get a true RGB value, this becomes R=0, G=252,B=252.
           You couldn't tell the difference by looking, but DeuTex can.
           It will take this value and say "Hmmm... Light Blue". Your
           graphic will be disappointing when you see it in Doom :-<
           -rgb 0 252 252 will make you smile again :-)

           Another example of when you might want to use this command
           is if you use a raytracer to create your graphics. Most of
           these programs render the background as black. If you use
           the option -rgb 0 0 0, things will be much easier.

  -bmp      File format to use when EXTRACTING pictures. DeuTex will
  -gif      recognize either one when STORING pictures in a pwad. The
  -ppm      DOS version defaults to .BMP; the UNIX version defaults to
            .GIF. Avoid the 24bit BMP format! Use 8bit (256 color) and
            have the color quantization done by a serious program. Mine
            works if you need it, but it's lame. See "What are the
            Palettes For?" in Chapter 1.

  -wave     File format to use when EXTRACTING sounds (DeuTex will
  -au       recognize either one when INSERTING sounds). The DOS
  -voc      version defaults to .WAV; the UNIX version defaults to .AU.









                                                                  page 24




  -level    These tell DeuTex to select Sprites, patches, sounds, etc.
  -lump     when composing/decomposing/merging pwads.  These commands
  -texture  can be combined.  By default, all entries are selected.
  -sound
  -graphic
  -sprite
  -patch
  -flat

  -iwad     To be used with -make, this command makes an iwad instead
            of a pwad. This is necessary if you are building a pwad
            which contains all the Sprites and/or all the Flats. This
            enables you to rebuild the DOOM.wad if really needed.


                --------------------------------------
D)              COMMANDS TO COMPOSE OR DECOMPOSE pwads
                --------------------------------------

  -wadir <thatcool.wad>

            Directory list, with entry identification. Exact
            entry identification is sometimes impossible in a
            pwad. In that case, Sprites, Flats or patches might
            be reported as Graphics.

  -xtract  <thatcool.wad>
  -extract <thatcool.wad>

            Will extract Lumps, Graphics, Flats, patches, Sprites,
            sounds and Levels from a wad and put them into a
	    subdirectory having the same name (all .LMPs in \LUMPS, etc).
            Also lists any Texture entries of the wad in a file called
            TEXTURE1.TXT, which it puts in a subdirectory called
            \TEXTURES. If you are extracting the main DOOM1 wad, a
            second Texture file, TEXTURE2.TXT will be extracted. DOOM2
            does not have a TEXTURE2 entry. If a given subdirectory
            does not exist, it will be created. Also creates the file
            wadINFO.TXT in the working directory. The working directory
            is the directory the command is entered from unless -dir is
            used to specify one.  See the Chapter 8 - FORMATS for a
            description of wadINFO.TXT, TEXTURE1.TXT and TEXTURE2.TXT.
            This command will not overwrite already existing entries.
            It will complain and stop instead.


  -get  <entry> <thatcool.wad>

           Will retrieve the entry called <entry> as picture, sound or
           lump, from <thatcool.wad>. if <thatcool.wad> is unspecified
           this default to the main wad.
           This is no more than an emulation of DMGRAPH/DMAUD.

+  -usedtex  <thatcool.wad>
+
+           This command will scan the level files in the pwad, and report
+           all the texture names that are affectively used.
+           Use this when you convert pwads from Doom to Doom2 or Heretic
+           so as to know which texture you really need.


                                                                  page 25                                                                 page 25




-make     <wadinfo.txt>  <myown.wad>
-build    <wadinfo.txt>  <myown.wad>
-create   <wadinfo.txt>  <myown.wad>

            Reads wadINFO.TXT and uses it to compose MYOWN.wad from the
            files in the subdirectories. See FORMATS for a description
            of wadINFO.TXT. MYOWN.wad will be created in the current
            directory. If it already exists, it WON'T be overwritten,
            so it must be deleted or moved to create a new version. This
            command replaces DMGRAPH, DMMUS, DMTEX and DMAUD. (DMAUD
            recognises more formats than .WAV and .AU, but it doesn't
            work with Doom v1.666 or Doom2).

+ -s_end
+           This switch is only related to an ugly trick with sprites.
+           This special switch shall be placed *before* -make when
+           you want to build a special sprite pwad. Such a pwad require
+           that you patch the game executable, so it's not for newbies.
+           Don't use that switch unless you really mean it.


-check  <myown.wad>

          Will look for any Textures defined in MYOWN.wad which contain
          void columns that would crash Doom. Use this after modifying
          Textures (Similar to the way you use checks in DEU).
+         It will also report the textures that cannot be used in a
+         Two sided wall (a medusa effect would happen if you used them).

-unused <thatlame.wad>

          Checks for unused bytes in a pwad. Reports all the unused
          zones, total number of byte wasted, and the repartition
          depending on size of wasted areas.


             ---------------------------------------------
E)           COMMANDS FOR MERGING pwads INTO THE MAIN iwad
             ---------------------------------------------

-merge  <myown.wad>

            Will put the entries of MYOWN.wad into the main Doom.wad
            file, thereby removing all restrictions Doom puts on pwads.
            This is much safer and much cleaner than inserting or
            restoring entries with DMGRAPH or such, but your iwad IS
            modified. Usually used for Sprites and Flats.

-restore    Will restore DOOM.wad and the merged MYOWN.wad.  To be
            used after the -merge command, to undo the job. Files are
            reconstructed using information stored in the iwad at the
            time the -merge is done.

-join  <myfirst.wad>  <mysecond.wad>

+           Will join two pwads:  mysecond.wad is put inside myfirst.wad.
+           Great for combining pwads!
+           If entries are duplicated, mysecond.wad has priority
+           If custom textures are defined in both wads, they are
+           preserved, but those of mysecond.wad have priority.

                                                                  page 26

-app   <mysprite.wad>

+           Appends all sprites and flats to a pwad.
+           this is necessary before a pwad defining custom sprites and
+           Flats is used with Doom. Doesn't work with Heretic 1.0,
+           but it should... another bug of Heretic...

+ -as <mysprite.wad>

+           Same as -sprites -app. Appends only Sprites.
+           (-as does the same thing as the corresponding NWT command)

+ -af <myflat.wad>

+           Same as -flats -app. Appends only Flats.
+           (-af does the same thing as the corresponding NWT command)


-add   <mysprite.wad> <myfinal.wad>

            Same thing as -app, but mysprite.wad is not modified.
            final.wad is generated instead. Avoid this, it waste space.
            (this is only for compatibility with the old DMADDS tool).


SAFEGUARD:
                - ONLY 8 BYTES of DOOM.wad are modified
                - If all else fails, you can restore your iwad by hand.
                - Only about 32k of additional disk space are needed.
                - MYOWN.wad is put INTACT into DOOM.wad. It can then be
                  deleted since -restore recreates it. This is barely a
                  modification at all!

How does it work?

     - Restoration information is added at the end of the iwad.
     - Then the pwad is pasted intact at the end of the iwad.
     - The iwad directory is rebuilt (about 32K) and appended.
     - The pointer to the Doom directory is modified (8 bytes).

After all that mess, a directory entry called _DEUTEX_ is added. it is
of no use for Doom/Heretic, and is just ignored. But if you modify
your wad with some other tool, this entry will still point to the
restoration information, enabling DeuTex to salvage the wad.

I did my best to make this command the safest possible. I have tested
this command thoroughly and believe it can be trusted. Be aware,
however, that the resulting iwad might not work with Doom if the
included pwad does not respect some conventions about Sprites and
Flats. If this happens, the files are still safe, just -restore them.

The conventions a pwad must follow are:

        -There must be F_START or FF_START before the first Flat.
        -There must be S_START or SS_START before the first Sprite.

Sorry, but there is NO OTHER WAY if we want to be able to add new
Sprites and Flats that are unreferenced in DOOM.wad.
It would be vain to compare the sprites names with those of the iwad,
because it's DOOM.EXE that determines which sprites are which, not
the iwad. And as DOOM.EXE can be hacked, and sprites vary with versions
of Doom, there is really no other choice.


                                                                  page 27




CHAPTER 7
*************************** DeuSF Commands ****************************

                              --------
A)                            OVERVIEW
                              --------

DeuSF is an improved replacement for DMADDS.  It adapts to all versions
of Doom, requires a less perverted pwad structure, and can append to a
pwad rather than generating a new pwad (thereby saving space). DeuSF
works with pwads composed for DMADDS, and should work for ones composed
for DMADDF. Of course, the PREFERRED pwad composer for DeuSF is DeuTex!

+ The code for DeuSF is 100% the same as that of DeuTex.
+ All the commands of DeuSF are the same as the DeuTex equivalent, but
+ since DeuSF is smaller, it's more suitable for distribution.

DeuSF need only be applied to pwads that contain:

        -some Sprites to replace those of DOOM.wad.
        -some Flats to replace those of DOOM.wad.

DeuSF need NOT be used if:

        - the pwad contains *all* the Sprites of DOOM.wad
        - the pwad contains *all* the Flats of DOOM.wad
        - the pwad contains Sprites which are not referenced in
          DOOM.EXE. (a DeHacked patch is needed to have them work)

DeuSF can only be used on pwads that respect a precise format:

 - Sprites are identified only if comprised between:

          S_START or SS_START    and    S_END or SS_END

 -Flats (floor/ceilings) are identified only if they occur between:

          F_START or FF_START    and    F_END or FF_END

If this format is NOT respected, DeuSF might fail to identify entries
correctly. This is because in iwad and pwad entries there is nothing
internal to a Sprite or Flat that identifies it as such. This format is
generated by DeuTex automatically, and is compatible with DMADDS.

DeuSF is meant to be distributed with your pwad, so it has no
restrictions on distribution (Unlike DeuTex, see License Section). This
lets you send DeuSF with your pwad, along with a batch file like the
one in the following example. Your pwad contains new Sprites and Flats,
but not all of them. Your batch file might read:

          DeuSF -app mywad.wad
          DOOM -file mywad.wad -warp x x
          DeuSF -res mywad.wad

First, DeuSF appends the Sprites and Flats from DOOM.wad to mywad.wad.
Then the pwad is played. The last command deletes the appended Sprites
and Flats from mywad.wad, restoring it to it's original condition.
This kind of pwad should PREFERABLY be built with DeuTex.



                                                                  page 28




An example of DeuSF usage on ALIENDOOM 2.2:

 DeuSF -doom c:\doom -sprite -add ALIENGFX.wad ALINGRFX.wad

 DeuSF reads ALIENGFX.wad to find what Sprites are missing. It then
 extracts them from DOOM.wad and creates a new pwad, ALINGRFX.wad from
 the original pwad and the extracted Sprites. DOOM.wad and the original
 ALIENGFX.wad are unchanged.

Even better:

 DeuSF -doom c:\doom -sprite -app ALIENGFX.wad > aliengfx.log

 DeuSF reads ALIENGFX.wad to find what Sprites are missing. It then
 extracts them from DOOM.wad and appends them to ALIENGFX.wad. DOOM.wad
 is unchanged. If -res doesn't work for any reason, ALIENGFX.wad can be
 restored by hand from the information in aliengfx.log

 You *should* take the time to evaluate this tool even if you're
 not convinced at all. Trust that this time won't be wasted.
 DeuSF -join, -merge, -app, -res commands are incredibly more
 powerful than those of DMADDS. NWT duplicate some of the
 features of DeuSF, but isn't par to DeuSF (as of NWT version 1.03).
 Great care involved in designing those DeuSF functions, and DeuSF in not
 only the most powerful, it's also the only one ported to other O/S.
 Let me insist that you should use DeuSF to install your wads.



                      --------------------------
B)                    COMPLETE COMMAND REFERENCE
                      --------------------------

 All optional commands must appear before all
 non-optional ones. Otherwise, they are ignored.

Command Line Format:
DeuSF <optional cmd.>,...,<non-optional cmd.>,...,etc.


******** 1) HELP COMMANDS

  -help     Lists these parameters.

  -format   Displays a summary of the format conventions
            a pwad must follow so that DeuSF can recognize
            Sprites and Flats properly.

  -wadir <thatcool.wad>

            Scrolls the entries in the pwad directory down the screen,
            along with what type DeuSF thinks each entry is (Sprite,
            Flat, Graphic, etc.). For a pwad with many entries, you
            may want to pipe this command (i.e. DeuSF -wadir | more)
            to ease readability. Used to check if DeuSF recognises all
            the entries correctly, for instance when there is a problem
            with -app or -add.




                                                                  page 29




******** 2) OPTIONAL COMMANDS



  -doom <doom directory>

            Use this command to indicate the directory containing the
            DOOM.wad and DOOM.EXE you want to use. See the description
            in  the DeuTex command reference for default information.

            For example:      DeuSF -doom C:\GAMES\DOOM

  -sprite   Use with -add or -app, to add only Sprites or only Flats. If
  -flat     neither of these commands is present, DeuSF will add both.




******** 3)  MANDATORY COMMANDS (one of these will always be used)



-add  <myown.wad> <allsf.wad>               (same as in DeuTex)

            Will create a new file, ALLSF.wad, containing all the
            Sprites and/or Flats of DOOM.wad together with those
            contained in MYOWN.wad. This is exactly like DMADDS
            ...but cleaner.

-app  <myown.wad>                           (same as in DeuTex)

            Will append to MYOWN.wad only those Sprites and/or Flats
            of DOOM which are not redefined. This saves disk space,
            compared to -add command.

-join <this.wad> <that.wad>

         Will append to THIS.wad all the Sprites and Flats contained in
         THAT.wad. This function enables you to merge two Sprite and/or
         Flats pwads obtained from different sources. I added this
         command so that I could play CHOOK and BARNEY together.
         TEXTURES and PNAMES entries of both THIS.wad and THAT.wad.
         If entries are conflicting, those of THAT.wad have priority.
         Avoid conflicts! -join is not really clever.

         NOTE: After using -join on pwads, you still have to
               use -app on the combined pwad to append the
               remaining Sprites and Flats from Doom.

-res <myown.wad>                             (same as in DeuTex)

          Restores a pwad which had been modified with -app command.
          Quite safe. Performs the same function as -restore in DeuTex.
          If a pwad was merged inside another one (using -join), then
          that pwad regenerated also. Now *that's* real cool!






                                                                  page 30




CHAPTER 8

******************************* FORMATS *******************************

                      ----------------------------
A)                     The wad Creation Directive
                              wadINFO.TXT
                      ----------------------------

******** 1) OVERVIEW

The creation directive file is used by the DeuTex -make command to
compile a pwad containing all of the desired enhancements. It is
automatically generated by the -xtract command and placed in the
working directory (e.g. MYwad\). You can rename this file whatever you
like, and reference it when you use the -make or -merge commands.

+ The file lists most of the entries which will be present in the pwad
+ file (with the exception of PATCHES and PNAMES, see note below). It is
+ structured similarly to a Windows .ini file with sections headed by
+ names enclosed in brackets.It contains up to 7 sections: [LEVELS],
+ [LUMPS], [TEXTURE1], [SOUNDS], [GRAPHICS], [SPRITES] and [FLATS].
+ For DOOM1, there can be an eighth section called [TEXTURE2].
+
+ All sections are optional. Starting with DeuTex version 3.0, the order
+ of the sections is not critical. The name of the section IS critical,
+ and must be spelled correctly.

NOTE: There is no [PATCHES] section. Patch loading is automatic. If a
      new patch is referenced in a Texture, DeuTex will look for it in
      \PATCHES. If there is a patch in \PATCHES with the same name
      as an existing patch, DeuTex will automatically find it and load
      it. There is no need to reference a redefined patch in a Texture
      definition, unless it is part of a new or redefined Texture. There
      is also no need to define PNAMES. PNAMES creation is automatic.

 The names TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 refer to the OLDTEX1.TXT and
 OLDTEX2.TXT files as extracted from Doom. Unlike previous versions,
 DeuTex doesn't need these files. They exist only for you. They are
 useful in examining the makeup of textures in the wad. They also make
 redefining existing Textures easier by allowing you to cut and paste
 instead of typing the redefined Texture from scratch. DeuTex 3.3 takes
 all the information on existing Textures directly from the main wad
 while building your pwad. Any new definitions supplied by you will
 override those in Doom. A warning will be given to inform you of this.
 This is a great improvement and makes DeuTex even easier than before!

 Previous versions of this manual also generated confusion over where,
 how, and if you need to use OLDTEX2.TXT (then named TEXTURE2.TXT)
 The short answer from now on is: NOWHERE, NOHOW and NO!

 Since DeuTex 3.1, [TEXTURE1] and [TEXTURE2] are separate sections.
 There is ONLY ONE case where you will use [TEXTURE2]. This is when you
 are using Doom1 and you redefine a TEXTURE2 Texture. OLDTEX2.TXT does
 NOT need to be present, even in this situation. Use it for your edits.

 If your pwad is for Doom2, or is for Doom1 and doesn't change any
 TEXTURE2 Textures, IGNORE all references to TEXTURE2 in this document!



                                                                  page 31




******** 2) EXACT FORMAT for wadINFO.TXT



 The following pages show the exact format for all the entries in a
 pwad Creation Directive File (i.e. wadINFO.TXT or YOURNAME.TXT).
 All main sections are optional. Order of sections is unimportant.

              Listing of the Format for wadINFO.TXT:

 ;
 ; DeuTex by Olivier Montanuy
 ;
 ;  pwad creation directives
 ;
 ;
 [LEVELS]       ; Section to define the Level of your map(s).
 ;
 MAPnm (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' and '=bbbb' are used, looks in \LEVELS for
 EnMm  (=bbbb)  ; aaaa.wad and bbbb.wad. If '=aaaa' and '=bbbb' are not
                ; used, looks in \LEVELS for MAPnm.wad and EnMm.wad.
                ; Combines them into one pwad containing MAPnm and EnMm
                ;
                ; DeuTex does not care about the internal Level of
                ; aaaa.wad or MAPnm.wad. It will output the pwad as
                ; whatever MAPnm or EnMm is put here. Easy conversion.
                ;
                ; EnMm can be E1M1 thru E3M9.
                ; MAPnm can be MAP01 thru MAP35.
                ; MAPS 33, 34 and 35 will play, but can only be entered
                ; by IDCLEV. An EXIT LEVEL switch on 33, 34 and 35 will
                ; just return you to DOS.
                ;
                ; If EnMm and MAPnm are entered in the same pwad, EnMm
                ; will play from Doom1 and MAPnm will play from Doom2,
                ; IF there are no Texture additions to the pwad. It is
                ; still possible with Textures, but is a can of worms,
                ; and you'd better know what you're doing.
                ;
                ; Thus, it is possible to make a 62 Level pwad with
                ; DeuTex, although some imagination would be needed to
                ; overcome the limitations of Levels 33, 34 and 35 in
                ; Doom2, and only about half the wad would be available
                ; to each Doom engine. This may be useless, but since
                ; it's possible, it is included here.
 ;
 ;
 [LUMPS]       ; Section to define any .LMP data you want to add.
               ; Chapter 5, Section B) describes Lumps.
 ;
 qqqq (=aaaa)  ; If '= aaaa' is used, looks in \LUMPS for aaaa.LMP. If
               ; '= aaaa' is not used, looks for qqqq.LMP. Installs the
               ; .LMP data in the pwad to replace qqqq in Doom.
 ;
 rrrr    (*)   ; If '*' is used, .LMP from the previous entry is used
               ; for this entry as well. When you play the pwad, qqqq
               ; will be used for both qqqq AND rrrr.
 ;
 ;










                                                                  page 33




 [TEXTURE1]  ; Section for declaring what Texture definition files you
             ; want to use when compiling your pwad.
 ;
  aaaa       ; First loads TEXTURE1 from the main Doom or Doom2 wad.
 (bbbb)      ; Then looks in \TEXTURES for aaaa.TXT. Compiles your pwad
 (cccc)      ; Texture directory by: TEXTURE1 - (redefined Textures in
             ; aaaa.TXT)+(ALL textures in aaaa.TXT) = TEXTURE1 in pwad.
             ;
             ; If 'bbbb' and 'cccc' are used, DeuTex searches for
             ; bbbb.TXT in \TEXTURES, RE-edits the TEXTURE1 entry using
             ; it, then gets cccc.TXT and repeats the process. This
             ; means that if any duplicate Texture names exist in aaaa,
             ; bbbb and cccc, only the entry from the last file listed
             ; will be present in the final pwad.
 ;
 [TEXTURE2]  ; Used only for Doom1. Shows what Texture definition
 aaaa        ; file(s) to use for TEXTURE2. Similar to above.
 ;
 ;
 [SOUNDS]        ; Section to define your modified sound entries.
 ;
 DSqqqq (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks in \SOUNDS for aaaa.WAV
                 ; (sound effect). If '= aaaa' isn't used, looks for
                 ; DSqqqq.WAV. Uses file to replace Doom sound DSqqqq.
 ;
 DPqqqq (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks in \SOUNDS for aaaa.TXT
                 ; (PC Speaker sound). If '= aaaa' is not used, looks
                 ; in \SOUNDS for DPqqqq.TXT. Uses file to replace
                 ; Doom PC Speaker sound DPqqqq.
 ;
 D_qqqq (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks in \SOUNDS for aaaa.MUS
                 ; (Music file in  Doom's .MUS format). If '=aaaa' is
                 ; not used, looks for D_qqqq.MUS. Uses file to replace
                 ; Doom Music D_qqqq.
 ;
 D_rrrr   (*)    ; If '*' is used, the sound from the previous entry is
                 ; used for this entry as well. In this example, when
                 ; you play your pwad, D_qqqq will be used for both
                 ;  D_qqqq AND D_rrrr.
 ;
 ;
 [GRAPHICS]             ; Section used to declare Graphics other than
                        ; Sprites, Flats, or Textures. See Chapter 5,
                        ; Section E) or Matt Fell's Doom specs for a
                        ; description of Graphic entries in Doom.
 ;
 qqqq (xx)(yy) (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks in \GRAPHICS for
                        ; aaaa.BMP. If not found, looks for aaaa.GIF.
                        ; If '=aaaa' is not used, looks for qqqq.BMP
                        ; or .GIF. Inserts the file in pwad for entry
                        ; qqqq. xx and yy are the horizontal and
                        ; vertical offsets used when inserting the
                        ; Graphic into it's defined area. The defined
                        ; defined area is predetermined by DOOM.EXE
                        ; from the Graphic name.
                        ;





                                                                  page 34




                        ; For example, all Graphics beginning with STF
                        ; are placed in a box 31 x35 pixels big at the
                        ; center of the Status Bar. This is where the
                        ; player's face shows up. The xx and yy values
                        ; move the Graphic around in this box. Positive
			; values move it left (xx) and up (yy).
 ;
 rrrr        (*)        ; If '*' is used, will re-use the Graphic from
                        ; the previous line for rrrr too.
 ;
 ;
 [SPRITES]              ; Section used to declare Sprites. Consult the
                        ; following for more information on modifying
                        ; Sprites in Doom:
                        ;   Chapter 3 - Section C)

                        ;   Chapter 7 - All Sections
 ;
 qqqq (xx)(yy) (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks for aaaa.BMP or
                        ; .GIF in \SPRITES. If '=aaaa' is not used,
                        ; looks for qqqq.BMP or GIF. Inserts the file
                        ; into the pwad to replace the Sprite qqqq.
 ;
 rrrr          (*)      ; '*' tells DeuTex to use the previous entry
                        ; (qqqq) for this Sprite as well.
 ;
 ;
 [FLATS]       ; Section for declaring modified Flats. Limitations
               ; are similar to the ones for modifying Sprites. See
               ; [SPRITES] section above for places to find info.
 ;
 qqqq (=aaaa)  ; If '=aaaa' is used, looks for aaaa.BMP or .GIF in
               ; \FLATS. If '=aaaa' is not used, looks for qqqq.BMP or
               ; .GIF. Inserts file into pwad as replacement for qqqq.
               ;
               ; There are no insertion points for Flats, since they
               ; all MUST be 64x64.

                  -----------------------------------
B.                 The Texture Definitions Text File
                         \TEXTURES\MYTEXT.TXT
                  -----------------------------------

******** 1) OVERVIEW

Some Notes on Texture definitions:

     - READ the DOOM SPECS by Matt Fell.
     - You can create Textures for transparent walls (see DeuTex
       Commands -rgb), but make sure that they're composed of only
       one patch. Otherwise, you'll get the Medusa Effect.
     - Avoid using a Texture less than 128 pixels high on a
       wall higher than the Texture (Tutti Frutti effect).
     - Texture widths should be rounded to the next power
       of 2. (8,16,64,128,256,512,1024 are usable)
     - Patches composing Textures can not be more than 320 pixels wide.
     - Doom will ignore any portion of Textures higher than 128 pixels.
     - You can create a non repeating sky Texture:
       Define the SKY1 (or SKY2, SKY3, RSKY1, RSKY2, RSKY3) entry as a
       1024x128 area cover it with patches. Note that SKY patches appear
       horizontally inverted. 0=east,  256=north, 512=west, 768=south.
     - Make sure all Textures are completely covered by patches.
       Otherwise, Doom will puke (void column error).
     - You can create animated walls with (almost) any sequence of
       pictures. No known limit in the number of frames (27 is OK!).
       The way to do this is:
       Edit the Textures of one of Doom's existing animated walls
       (beginning and end). Use the original names for these entries.
       They are coded into DOOM.EXE. Add the other frames for your
       animation between these entries in your Texture list.
     - READ the DOOM SPE.... Well, you get the picture >;-{]>

Once you have created a new pwad, check it with the -check command.
DeuTex will complain if:

     - Any Texture width is NOT a power of 2 (2,4,8,16,32,64,128,etc).
       (Doom will round to the next lower power of 2)
     - Any Texture height is greater than 128.
         (Doom ignores everything above 128)
     - Any Texture is not completely covered by patches.
       (Doom will exit with a void column error)
     - A Level tries to use of an undefined Texture.

A Texture entry consists of:

(Texture Name)      (WIDTH) (HEIGHT)
*     (Patch1)    (X offset)(Y offset)
*     (Patch2)    (X offset)(Y offset)
*     (Patch3)    (X offset)(Y offset)
 .          .          .         .
 .          .          .         .
 .          .          .         .
*     (PatchN)    (X offset)(Y offset)

This format is supported by both New Wad Tool and the Visual Basic
shell for DeuTex, so use the one you prefer, to build your Textures.



                                                                  page 39




Texture names are 8 characters or less.
Width and Height are in pixels.
An asterisk '*' identifies the following word as a PNAME.
Patch names are 8 characters or less.
X and Y offsets are pixel measurements.
Offsets are measured from upper-left corner (0,0).
X = positive. Offset patch to the right.
X = negative. Offset patch to the left.
Y = positive. Offset patch down.
Y = negative. Offset patch up.






The following figure is a feeble attempt to illustrate this:





 _______________________
|                       | ^
| PATCH 1               | |
| Both x and y          | Y
| have negative         | |

C)                   Where to get DeuTex/DeuSF
                     -------------------------


        The primary site for DeuTex is
                http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/deutex/

        DeuTex and DeuSF are meant to be available by anonymous
        FTP on Internet sites: the same as of those of DEU:

                ftp.cdrom.com,ftp.luth.se,iglou.com,...
                /pub/doom/utils/graphics_editing/deutex




        DeuTex and DeuSF are available on Compuserve, by special
        request of Dr. Sleep:

           GAMERS FORUM LIB 8 ACTION GAME AIDS [CIS:GAMERS]
           PC WORLD FORUM LIB 22 The DOOM ROOM [CIS:PWOFORUM]

WinTex
The graphic interface for DeuTex

NWT by Denis Moeller
A very good DOS Tool, easy to use. ideal for making small changes
to a wad. unsuitable for handling large set of entries.
Texture text format is compatible with DeuTex.


DOOMTEX by Steve McCrea
A list of tools to generate Textures. It's not exactly user friendly,
but successfully used for TRINITY.wad. For hackers only :-) I *do* hope
you'll find DeuTex a bit easier to use, but Steve was a pioneer in
the area of Texture editing!

WACKER by Keith Wilkins
A Graphic Texture editor. I could not test it, but it should be good.
It would be a good idea to use it in combination with DeuTex.

                             --------------
D)                           Known Problems
                             --------------

-  Color quantization is faster, but optimised for the Doom and Heretic
   palettes supplied with DeuTex. Else, it's slower and a bit lossy.

-  Identification of entry types does not always work with pwads made by
   programs other than DeuTex. There is no general solution to this
   problem, only my best effort. Sprites and Flats could be missed if
   certain conventions are not respected. Misidentified entries are
   stored as Lumps.

-  GIF format defaults to GIF87.

-  No MIDI support. MUS format is too complex to understand. No time.

-  DeuSF does NOT test that all REQUIRED sprite viewpoints are available
   if you change the number of viewpoints. Doom will lock up if you
   forget one of the sprite viewpoints.

-  If the -app command is interrupted, the pwad file becomes bigger due
   to appended waste data, but it is still operational.

-  DeuSF says stupid things if no command is given.

-  See TODO.

*Limitations of Doom

-  Sprites in pwads only work if you don't reuse existing sprites. Use
   DeuSF or DMADDS if you want to replace sprites. Actually, DeuTex
   -merge will also work. (and better!)

-  Flats don't work in pwads. Use DeuSF or DMADDS if you want to
   replace Flats.  Deutex -merge will also work. (and better!)

*Limitations of Heretic

- Sprites in pwad don't work at all.  use -merge. I don't know why...

First, thanks to you for taking the time to evaluate DeuTex/DeuSF.

understand, but I really think it's worth the trouble.

   Thanks to Justin Fisher for letting me use DeuTex and DeuSF on a
   new install for Alien-TC (despite all the small mistakes I made).

   Thanks to Jonathan Wilson <wilsonj@xoommail.com> for figuring out
   the formats of the Doom alpha and press release pre-beta pictures.

 Now comes the guy YOU all want to thank:

 Before his contribution, I was the only one who knew how to use DeuTex.
 Now some of you might understand enough about DeuTex to use it in your
 great Doom conversions project.

F)                           FINAL WORDS

                             -----------


Thanx for trying DeuTex.


 I did my best to make it the easy to use, bug free, and portable.
 However, it's not entirely trivial to use.
 I can't spend my life on a freeware tool.


 If you can't understand this tool, chances are your contribution
 to Doom fandom will be quite limited. Remember, I only worked to make
 your life as simple as it could be, so that even non-specialists
 could produce something cool for Doom.


 But don't forget that it takes some time, some dedication, and
 some genius also, to make something as great as Aliens-TC.

APPENDIX III     Listing of sound names for Doom I and II

*Ripped off from DMAUD by Bill Neisius*
Then corrected and expanded to include Doom II sounds for this manual.
DeuTex uses Doom's sound names rather than the artificial sound numbers
used in DMAUD. A Conversion table for this follows.

NOTE: An asterisk '*' means the sound is used for multiple functions.

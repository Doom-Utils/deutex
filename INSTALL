        * Structure of the sources *
        ****************************

DeuTex and DeuSF share the same sources.
When compiling, you must include all sources and define one of
those flags so that the C pre-processor knows which part to select:

- DeuSF                   to compile DeuSF
- DeuTex                  to compile DeuTex
For a windows DLL
- LDeuTex                 to compile DeuTex.DLL for Windoze

Borland C++
Turbo C++

    DeuTex can be built with Borland C++ 4.0. Other versions of the
    Borland compilers might work too but they've not been tried. To
    compile, type

	dos\buildbc dir

    where dir is the directory where the compiler is installed,
    followed by a backslash (E.G. "dos\buildbc c:\bc4\"). Once
    deusf.exe and deutex.exe are built, copy them manually to a
    directory in your path.

    Don't try to use the makefile; due to idiosyncrasies in the CLI of
    bcc, limitations of Borland make and of the FAT filesystem, it
    won't work. There are old project files lying around in old but
    they've not been updated since 1995 so don't use them either.

    The compiler can be configured so that "{rw}" opens files in
    binary mode. Don't do that ! If you have problems with text files
    on DOS, make sure the compiler is configured so that "{rw}" opens
    files in _text_ mode (that's the default).

Microsoft C

    As of version 4, DeuTex can be built with MSC 6.0. Other versions
    of MSC might work too, but have not been tried. To compile with
    MSC 5.1, you would have to remove the #error directives, since
    these are not supported in that version.
    
    To compile, type

	dos\buildmsc

    (that script assumes INCLUDE, LIB and PATH are properly set up).
    Once deusf.exe and deutex.exe are built, copy them manually to a
    directory in your path.

    The compiler can be configured so that "{rw}" opens files in
    binary mode. Don't do that ! If you have problems with text files
    on DOS, make sure the compiler is configured so that "{rw}" opens
    files in _text_ mode (that's the default).

DJGPP 2.*

    Thanks to Udo Munk, DeuTex can now be built with DJGPP.

    You need a Unix toolset comprising ln, sh and touch. Certain
    targets also require cp, GNU find, lynx, rm, tar, tr zip and a
    Unix mkdir but those are maintainer targets and you probably don't
    need them.

    To compile, type

	make

    If it doesn't work, tell me about it. You will get a warning about
    ftruncate() being undeclared. ftruncate() is supposed to be a Unix
    function. If you have a unistd.h header, try to insert a "#include
    <unistd.h>" in tools.c. Else, I don't know what to do.

    After deusf.exe and deutex.exe are created, copy them to a
    directory in your path.

Cygwin

    Thanks to Udo Munk, DeuTex can now be built with Cygwin.

    You need a Unix toolset comprising ln, sh and touch. Certain
    targets also require cp, GNU find, lynx, rm, tar, tr zip and a
    Unix mkdir but those are maintainer targets and you probably don't
    need them.

    To compile, type

	make
	     
    and then copy deusf.exe and deutex.exe to a directory in your
    path. If it doesn't work, tell me about it.


        ***************
        * Windoze 3.1 *
        ***************
        by Olivier Montanuy

Use the DOS deutex version under windows, with a suitable deutex.pif

.DLL
DeuTex itself can't be compiled as a 16-bit windoze DLL (too big).
the lbdeutex is for the visual basic shell.

Unix:   Sun Sparc 1, 10, 20, IPX
gcc:    2.5.8
The makefile provided for Unix and Linux does not compile .o
objects. it compiles .ot for DeuTex and .os for DeuSF.
That little trick is useful to avoid linker problems.
type:   make
	make install (as root)

Borland C++
Turbo C++

    Might work. See the corresponding paragraphs in the DOS section.

Microsoft C

    Might work. See the corresponding paragraphs in the DOS section.

IBM C Set++ 2.1 (by mark.mathews@channel1.com)

    For DEUTEXOS.EXE you need deutexos.mak and deutexos.def
    To make DEUTEXOS.EXE type:  nmake -f deutexos.mak

    For DEUSFOS.EXE you need deusfos.mak and deusfos.def
    To make DEUSFOS.EXE type :  nmake -f deusfos.mak

    AYM 1999-08-12: Where are deutexos.mak and deusfos.mak ? Better use
    the main makefile anyway...


        ************************
        * Porting DeuTex/DeuSF *
        ************************

The name of the OS DeuTex is being compiled for is in DT_OS, defined in
deutex.h :

  #define DT_OS 'd'  /* MS-DOS */
  #define DT_OS 'o'  /* OS/2 */
  #define DT_OS 'u'  /* Unix (in fact, anything else) */

The name of the compiler is in DT_CC, defined in deutex.h :

  #define DT_CC 'b'  /* Borland C */
  #define DT_CC 'c'  /* GCC/EGCS with Cygwin */
  #define DT_CC 'd'  /* DJGPP */
  #define DT_CC 'g'  /* GCC/EGCS */
  #define DT_CC 'i'  /* IBM C Set++ */
  #define DT_CC 'm'  /* Microsoft C */
  #define DT_CC '?'  /* Unknown compiler */

Testing the existence of other macros, such as __MSDOS__, __GNUC__ etc.
is discouraged. Use DT_OS and DT_CC instead.

DeuTex uses specified size types Int16, Int32, UInt32, etc. Those are
defined in deutex.h. The definitions are believed to be correct for all
16-bit and 32-bit platforms. 64-bit platforms might require some
tweaking there. There is an alternate set of #define directives under
#ifdef __alpha but a clever use of limits.h and/or inttypes.h might be a
better idea. If you're the lucky owner of a 64-bit machine, send me your
diffs. Note that DeuTex and DeuSF check that the specified size types
are correctly defined and warn you if they aren't.

Some structures related to pictures or to DOOM assumes that no word or
long word alignement occur.  if the entries are not put contiguously,
DeuTex/DeuSF will not work, but there will be no warning.

Most of the O/S related functions are in tools.c.

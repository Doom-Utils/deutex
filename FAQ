                            DeuTex FAQ

1. When I extract the contents of the Heretic iwad, why are CREDIT, E2END,
FINAL1, FINAL2, HELP1, HELP2 and TITLE extracted into lumps/ and not into
graphics/ ?

    They're extracted into lumps/ because that's what they are. The
    graphics/ directory is for images that are in the in the so-called
    "picture" format, described in section [5-1] of the [1]UDS
    ([2]HTTP link). Those lumps are not in picture format, they're
    just straight bitmaps (320  * 200 pixels, 64,000 bytes).

    The distinction may seem academic, but it isn't. If those lumps
    were extracted into graphics/, it would be impossible to compose
    your wad correctly afterwards. In the wad created by DeuTex,
    CREDIT and friends would be in the picture format while the engine
    expects them to be in the 64000-byte matrix format.

2. When I extract the contents of the Hexen iwad, why are CREDIT, FINALE1,
FINALE2, FINALE3, HELP1, HELP2, INTERPIC and TITLE extracted into lumps/
and not into graphics/ ?

    See question [3]1.

3. I've composed a wad. When I play it, the transparent areas in the
graphics look opaque and blue or grey, like this :

    This is what happens when you try to use DeuTex 4 on files
    extracted by DeuTex 3 or WinTex.

    It happens because DeuTex 3 and WinTex use (0, 255, 255) (cyan)
    for transparent areas while DeuTex 4 uses (0, 47, 47) (dark
    blue-green). Therefore, what looks like a transparent pixel to
    DeuTex 3 and WinTex just looks like an opaque, cyan pixel to
    DeuTex 4. The closest match to cyan in the Doom palette is (115,
    115, 255) (blue-mauve) so that's what you get.

    Try one of the following :

       * convert your files to use (0, 47, 47) instead of (0, 255,
         255),
       * recreate your files using DeuTex 4,
       * recreate your files using DeuTex 3 with the "-rgb 0 47 47"
         option,
       * recreate your files using WinTex using the appropriate option
         (if it exists),
       * when composing, give DeuTex 4 the "-rgb 0 255 255" option.

4. The musics are extracted into lumps/.

    This has been fixed in version 4.4.

5. When composing, is there a way to include only the resources actually
used by the levels ?

    No. Though it would certainly be nice to have.

                             To-do list for DeuTex
                                       
     * In the directives file and textures files, "include" directive to
       include the rest of another block/file.
     * In the directives file and textures files, allow references to
       environment variables (E.G. $E(name))
     * In the directives file and textures files, allow user variables
       (E.G. $(name))
     * Make it easier to let a texture have a description identical to
       another texture
     * In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all
       except named flats as patches.
     * In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all
       except named patches as flats. This implies 1) accepting flats
       larger than 64×64 (by clipping) 2) converting transparent pixels
       to a certain colour (which one ?).
     * In the directives file, add a mean to automatically generate a
       texture for all/only named/all except named patches. The height of
       the automatic texture is 128, its width is the least power of two
       wide enough to contain the patch. The automatic texture is filled
       with the patch by tiling, starting from the top left corner. The
       name of the automatic texture is the name of the patch.
     * Patches > 255 high
     * Make sure that support for Strife is complete.
     * When doing -xtract/-make of strife0.wad, creates .au sound files
       but is not able to read them back ("WAV: Can't read dsswish.au" or
       something like that).
     * Instead of allowing any and all characters in the script file,
       require them to be quoted. And, when doing -xtract, produce the
       script file with the appropriate quotes... Since, under Unix, the
       only characters that are not allowed in a file name are NUL and
       "/", I don't see why DeuTex should prevent users from extracting
       lumps with weird characters in their names. However, that might
       cause compatilibity problems with the DOS version.
     * The presence of the GIF routines might prevent DeuTex to be
       distributed in the main section of Debian. Would it be sufficient
       to #ifdef them out ?
     * The command line interface is not always intuitive and fussy about
       the position of certain options.
     * Regarding audio support, Matthew W. Miller <mattm@infinet.com>
       offered the following comment on 1999-07-04 :
       
     Audio handling in deutex (I'm referring to the irix 5.3 version's
     included source code) is, I believe, based on dmgraph, but is
     pretty dire in any case.
     Imported sounds are all resampled to 11025 Hz, even though that
     hasn't been necessary since some time between v1.2 and v1.666
     (basically, any version that uses the item-respawn sound has the
     improved sound engine). Exasperatingly, lxdoom (or maybe sndserv?)
     takes several steps back by expecting sounds to be *raw* 11025 Hz
     data. You may be able to set new options to reflect this.
     Also, one would hope that eventually one or more of the source
     ports will start to support bitrates other than 8 bit, and (maybe?)
     stereo samples. You may want to start leaning on various source
     ports' programmers to get their acts together and start coming to
     some sort of agreement. ;)
     Importation of .wav files is pretty crufty. Like dmgraph before it,
     the deutex 5.3 source expects there to be just one big 'data'
     chunk, and doesn't notice the 'info' chunks that certain stupid
     Windows programs (*cough*cough*CoolEdit*GoldWave*cough*) insist on
     putting in (usually with copyright messages for the program itself,
     which in a just world would be illegal). Greater explanation of all
     this whacky chunk business can be found at:
     [1]http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~maniac/resource_web/wav_file_forma
     t/ (wav1.htm, wav2.htm, wav3.htm, 4.htm, 5.htm)
     Essentially, you want to clip out the first 'data' chunk and ignore
     crap like 'info', 'inam', 'list', or whatever.
     * TBD: New options -fstart and -fend to control the start-of-flats
       and end-of-flats markers used in pwads. Default to FF_START and
       F_END respectively. Warning: here again, don't use those options
       just because they're here. The default markers are perfectly fine,
       and they conform to the de-facto standard. If you deviate from
       them, you're asking for trouble.
     * -f_end
     * In the doc, mention that negative patch Y-offsets are forced to 0
       by the engine.
     * Why does DeuTex sometimes includes patches even if you don't
       mention them explicitly and sometimes doesn't ?
     * Make a DOS binary distribution with all filenames 8.3, all
       documentation in CRLF & CP437 format, no sources, no makefile,
       only DOS executables.
     * Options shouldn't care whether there is space between them and
       their argument.
     * Man page: mention that some options are DeuTex-only, not DeuSF.
     * Man page: insert `deutex -man` automatically.
     * Alpha port: look into 64-bit longs.
     * -check shouldn't require an argument. It should use the iwad by
       default.
     * -main should be implemented for DeuTex as well.
     * DeuTex should not look for doom.wad in the directory set by
       -heretic !
     * WAV to Doom sound: the warning "shrinking ... to 11025" should
       mention the name of the file or appear only once.
     * PPM to Doom graphics: the warning "quantisation is slow" should
       either mention the name of the file or appear only once.
     * Determine why converting Doom graphics to PPM and back does not
       yield the same thing. This also happens with BMP but much less so.
     * Bug: certain flats seem to be extracted with certain pixels set to
       the transparent colour (Doom's CEIL4_1). DeuTex 3.6 for DOS
       exhibits the same problem [1].
     * Hexen: DeuTex does not handle the BEHAVIOR lumps correctly.
     * Hexen: does not extract graphics quite correctly (applies
       transparent colour translation to opaque images such as FINALE1
       and FINALE2. This is probably related to [1].
     * Hexen: when trying to build back the hexen wad, got
Color palette is unknown
WARNING unknown palette. Using colour 0xff as transparentcolour.
Some graphics may appear moth-eaten.
Making lumps
Bug: *** idinx ***
     * WinTex status: add link to www.doomworld.com/deskdoom/
       (thomas@uprun.com)
     * Why does "deutex -ipf alpha -doom .. -sprites -graphics -patches
       -xtract" trigger "Error: *** Can't open file ./lumps/titlepic.lmp
       ***" ?
     * When extracting the Doom alpha 0.2 iwad, "Can't find PNAMES in
       wad".
     * Alpha: extracting levels not possible yet. Some graphics are
       extracted as lumps (MSKUL*, TITLEPIC...).
     * Building seems to be slower than extracting. Perhaps RAWtoPIC
       could use some optimization.
     * Include the palettes in the distribution.

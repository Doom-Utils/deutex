                             To-do list for DeuTex
                                       
Directives file

     * In the directives file and textures files, "include" directive to
       include the rest of another block/file.
     * In the directives file and textures files, allow references to
       environment variables (E.G. $E(name))
     * In the directives file and textures files, allow user variables
       (E.G. $(name))
     * Make it easier to let a texture have a description identical to
       another texture
     * In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all
       except named flats as patches.
     * In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all
       except named patches as flats. This implies 1) accepting flats
       larger than 64×64 (by clipping) 2) converting transparent pixels
       to a certain colour (which one ?).
     * In the directives file, add a mean to automatically generate a
       texture for all/only named/all except named patches. The height of
       the automatic texture is 128, its width is the least power of two
       wide enough to contain the patch. The automatic texture is filled
       with the patch by tiling, starting from the top left corner. The
       name of the automatic texture is the name of the patch.
     * Instead of allowing any and all characters in the script file,
       require them to be quoted. And, when doing -xtract, produce the
       script file with the appropriate quotes... Since, under Unix, the
       only characters that are not allowed in a file name are NUL and
       "/", I don't see why DeuTex should prevent users from extracting
       lumps with weird characters in their names. However, that might
       cause compatilibity problems with the DOS version.
       
Game support

     * Doom alpha GNUM[0-9] :
          + find name for 10x12, preferably ending in "p" (xxx),
          + implement IDENTxxx(),
          + add [xxx] section to wadinfo.txt,
          + make list of lumps that used to go in lumps/ and now go in
            xxx/ and put that in changes.html,
          + create corresponding -sprites-like option
     * When extracting the Doom alpha 0.2 iwad, "Can't find PNAMES in
       wad".
     * DeuTex should not look for doom.wad in the directory set by
       -heretic !
     * Heretic: E2END is extracted with the wrong palette.
     * Hexen: does not extract graphics quite correctly (applies
       transparent colour translation to opaque images such as FINALE1
       and FINALE2. This is probably related to [1].
     * Make sure that support for Strife is complete.
       
Graphics

     * Patches > 255 high
     * The presence of the GIF routines might prevent DeuTex to be
       distributed in the main section of Debian. Would it be sufficient
       to #ifdef them out ?
     * Determine why converting Doom graphics to PPM and back does not
       yield the same thing. This also happens with BMP but much less so.
       Update 2000-01-04 : for example, with Heretic, patch WALL17 has
       its (4Eh, 50h, 4Dh) pixels turned into (4Eh, 4Eh, 4Eh). It seems
       DeuTex sometimes uses a close match even when an exact match
       exists.
     * Bug: some flats seem to be extracted with certain pixels set to
       the transparent colour (Doom's CEIL4_1). DeuTex 3.6 for DOS
       exhibits the same problem [1].
     * Building seems to be slower than extracting. Perhaps RAWtoPIC()
       could use some optimization.
     * Include the Gimp and PSP palettes in the distribution.
     * For people who have old graphics files generated by DeuTex 3 with
       cyan (0, 255, 255) as the transparent colour : it would be nice if
       DeuTex 4 could import those files automatically. The way I see it,
       if no transparent pixel has been found in an image so far and if a
       cyan pixel is found, a warning is emitted ("Warning: xxxxxxxx.xxx:
       assuming the transparent colour is cyan.") and the transparent
       colour for this image is set to cyan. This would make for a smooth
       transition from DeuTex 3 to DeuTex 4. There should be a
       command-line switch to disable that feature.
     * Sneas are supported when doing -xtract but not when doing -build
       (they're ignored). Fix that, or at least mention it somewhere.
       Though I don't see many people wanting to make wads for Doom alpha
       anyway...
       
Sound

     * Regarding audio support, Matthew W. Miller <mattm@infinet.com>
       offered the following comment on 1999-07-04 :
       
     Audio handling in deutex (I'm referring to the irix 5.3 version's
     included source code) is, I believe, based on dmgraph, but is
     pretty dire in any case.
     Imported sounds are all resampled to 11025 Hz, even though that
     hasn't been necessary since some time between v1.2 and v1.666
     (basically, any version that uses the item-respawn sound has the
     improved sound engine). Exasperatingly, lxdoom (or maybe sndserv?)
     takes several steps back by expecting sounds to be *raw* 11025 Hz
     data. You may be able to set new options to reflect this.
     Also, one would hope that eventually one or more of the source
     ports will start to support bitrates other than 8 bit, and (maybe?)
     stereo samples. You may want to start leaning on various source
     ports' programmers to get their acts together and start coming to
     some sort of agreement. ;)
     Importation of .wav files is pretty crufty. Like dmgraph before it,
     the deutex 5.3 source expects there to be just one big 'data'
     chunk, and doesn't notice the 'info' chunks that certain stupid
     Windows programs (*cough*cough*CoolEdit*GoldWave*cough*) insist on
     putting in (usually with copyright messages for the program itself,
     which in a just world would be illegal). Greater explanation of all
     this whacky chunk business can be found at:
     [1]http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~maniac/resource_web/wav_file_forma
     t/ (wav1.htm, wav2.htm, wav3.htm, 4.htm, 5.htm)
     Essentially, you want to clip out the first 'data' chunk and ignore
     crap like 'info', 'inam', 'list', or whatever.

Bug: *** not a WAVE ***
Please report that bug.
     * WAV to Doom sound: the warning "shrinking ... to 11025" should
       mention the name of the file or appear only once.
     * Look into importing sounds as .wav's. What are the highest
       supported sample rates and resolution ? Seems to depend on the
       engine.
       
Command line

     * The command line interface is not always intuitive and it's fussy
       about the position of certain options. -iwad seems to be
       ineffective if placed last. -xtract and friends must be placed
       last if they don't have all their arguments.
     * Options shouldn't care whether there is space between them and
       their argument. Hmm... or should they ?
     * -check shouldn't require an argument. It should use the iwad by
       default.
     * -main should be implemented for DeuTex as well.
     * Matthew Miller wants to be able to specify the name of the iwad
       instead of just its path (this is how it should have been done
       from the start, IMHO). Possible ways to do that :
          + stat() the argument to -doom, -heretic, etc. If it's a file
            and not a directory, use that.
          + Look for a different basename in the iwad directory,
            depending on the option through which the directory was
            specified. E.G. if it was set with -doom2, look for doom2.wad
            first. And if doom2.wad was not found, emit a warning. -doom
            and -heretic should look for all basenames because that's
            what previous versions of DeuTex did.
          + Add an option to specify the name of the iwad file, without
            specifying which iwad it is and let DeuTex guess what needs
            to be guessed. Apparently, there's already such an option
            (-main) but it's for DeuSF only. Why ?
       
Documentation

     * It's in shambles.
     * Mention that negative patch Y-offsets are forced to 0 by the
       engine.
     * Mention that sneaps are extracted but not built.
     * Man page: mention that some options are DeuTex-only, not DeuSF.
     * Man page: insert `deutex -man` automatically.
       
Platform

     * Alpha port: look into 64-bit longs.
     * Borland C: to revive the port, must find a way to make all
       pointers implicitly huge.
       
Misc.

     * TBD: New options -fstart and -fend to control the start-of-flats
       and end-of-flats markers used in pwads. Default to FF_START and
       F_END respectively. Warning: here again, don't use those options
       just because they're here. The default markers are perfectly fine,
       and they conform to the de-facto standard. If you deviate from
       them, you're asking for trouble.
     * -f_end
     * Why does "deutex -ipf alpha -doom .. -sprites -graphics -patches
       -xtract" trigger "Error: *** Can't open file ./lumps/titlepic.lmp
       ***" ?
     * todo.html grows faster than changes.html. Fix that. ;-)
     * There are too many warnings for a 25-line display. Keep a copy in
       deutex.log ?
     * -usedidx: don't count sneats (-nosneats ?).

DeuTex
======

DeuTex can do many things with _Doom_, _Freedoom_, _Heretic_, _Hexen_,
and _Strife_ https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD[“WAD”] files, such as
extracting and inserting graphics, sounds, levels, and other
resources.  It can be used for creating and modifying IWAD (“Internal
WAD”) and PWAD (“Patch WAD”) files both.

It is a command-line driven program and as such, is suitable for
scripting such as from a shell script or Makefile.

File formats
------------

For insertion and extraction, DeuTex supports a few common formats.

For music, DeuTex supports both the DMX “mus” file format native to
_Doom_, and also MIDI files supported in _Doom_ 1.666 and newer.
There is no conversion between these formats, they are inserted and
extracted as-is.

For audio samples, they are saved and read using simple WAV files
containing only uncompressed PCM audio streams.

For the various forms of graphics, the BMP (uncompressed only), GIF,
PPM, and PNG footnote:[Requires libpng 1.6 or newer.] formats are
supported.

Unrecognized-format lumps are saved with +.lmp+ extension in the
+lumps+ directory and are re-inserted as-is from there.  Levels are
saved in an encapsulated PWAD file; breaking them apart would not be
useful for editing and all the lumps that make up a level are
co-dependent on each other.

Building and installing
-----------------------

DeuTex uses an Autoconf+Automake build system, so its compilation and
installation process is identical to most other Unix packages:

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make install

When building directly from the version control repository, you will
need autoconf and automake installed and run the `./bootstrap` command
first to generate the `./configure` file.

To build and install the manpage, AsciiDoc must be installed, in
particular the DocBook-based `a2x` command for transforming it into
manpage format.  DeuTex will still build without it, however, and the
AsciiDoc source in +man/deutex.txt+ is fairly readable on its own.

To build and install on ReactOS or Microsoft Windows will require an
environment compatible with Unix shells and programs, such as
https://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] or http://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2].

History
-------

DeuTex began life as a fork of Doom Editing Utilities (known as DEU
for short) by Olivier Montanuy in 1994, expunging the graphical user
interface in favor of command line and scriptable usage scenarios.
Originally written for DOS, its primary home is now modern Unix and
Windows systems, and is a fundamental piece to building
_https://freedoom.github.io/[Freedoom’s]_ IWAD files.

The name comes from a play on LaTeX and in turn TeX, a popular
typesetting system in academia but no technical connection to DeuTex.
It is pronounced as two syllables, the first like “due” or “dew,” and
the second like “tech” (not “tex”!), owing from its namesake.

5.0.0 (2017-??-??)
------------------

Removed features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * DeuSF.
  * `-man` troff format generation.
  * WinTex options.
  * `-fullsnd`: now the only mode.
  * MS-DOS and OS/2 compatibility.
  * Incomplete (and conditioned out) Rise of the Triad support.

File format support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * PNG support added, creating an optional dependency on libpng 1.6.
    If compiled in, it is the default extraction format, PPM
    otherwise.
  * Au and VOC sound formats removed.  WAV is the only supported
    format for extraction and creation.
  * Full sound lumps from the WAD are always extracted.
  * MIDI files can be included just by being named *.mid, and are
    extracted to the same file name extension.

General
~~~~~~~
  * Log file support has been removed, in favor of the user doing a
    shell redirection (eg, with `>` or `2>`) instead.
  * Arch-vile sprites are now extracted and inserted using literal
    names for sprites with the `[` and `]` characters in names
    (illegal file name characters on DOS, but not current Windows
    systems), and sprite names with `\` are now altered to use `^`
    on-disk, matching the ZDoom PK3 standard.
  * Graphics with a height > 128 and < 256 are now inserted into Doom
    WAD files correctly.
  * UDMF (Universal Doom Map Format) support.

Build systems, code standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Real Autoconf+Automake build system to replace the
    barely-functioning imitation one.  `./configure`, `make`, and
    related environment variables work as should be expected.
  * MS-DOS and OS/2 batch files removed.
  * A `malloc.h` include was removed to allow compilation on Mac OS X,
    and is not needed by current Unix systems in general.
  * Thousands of lines of code deleted and the entire tree reformated
    (primarily by using `indent -kr`, followed up by manual
    touch-ups).  Several unused files, functions, and commented out
    code removed.
  * C99-style cleanups to use (`u`)`intN_t` types, `bool`, `true`,
    `false` throughout the code, replacing old defines.
  * AsciiDoc now used for documentation, and building the manpage
    requires it to be installed.

// Old release notes for 4.4.902 and earlier are not (presently)
// available in this file.  See the version control repository for those
// details.

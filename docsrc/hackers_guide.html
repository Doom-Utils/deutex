    <h2>Endianness</h2>

    <p>
      Some files contain numbers that have a fixed endianness, independent from
      the endianness of the CPU DeuTex happens to run on.
      These call for some special treatment, as the C language has no provision
      for reading and writing integers otherwise than in the native endianness.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
	  To read an integer from a file with a particular endianness, use
	  <code>fread_i16_le()</code>, <code>fread_i16_be()</code>,
	  <code>fread_i32_le()</code> and <code>fread_i32_be()</code>.
	  The first argument is the file descriptor, the second argument is a
	  pointer on a variable that will receive the value read from the file.
	</p>

      <li>
        <p>
	  To write an integer to a file with a particular endianness, use
	  <code>fwrite_i16_le()</code>, <code>fwrite_i16_be()</code>,
	  <code>fwrite_i32_le()</code> and <code>fwrite_i32_be()</code>.
	  The first argument is the file descriptor, the second argument is the
	  value to write.
	</p>

      <li>
        <p>
	  To read an integer with a particular endianness from a memory area,
	  use <code>read_i16_le()</code>, <code>read_i16_be()</code>,
	  <code>read_i32_le()</code> and <code>read_i32_be()</code>.
	  The first argument is a pointer on the memory area, the second
	  argument is a pointer on a variable that will receive the value read
	  from the memory area.
	  Alternatively, you can use the <code>peek_i*()</code> functions that
	  take no second argument but instead return the read value.
	</p>

      <li>
        <p>
	  To write an integer with a particular endianness to a memory area,
	  use <code>write_i16_le()</code>, <code>write_i16_be</code>,
	  <code>write_i32_le()</code> and <code>write_i32_be()</code>.
	  The first argument is a pointer on the memory area, the second
	  argument is the value to write.
	</p>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Mnemonic to remember the arguments order&nbsp;: the object that has a
      defined endianness is considered central and therefore always comes
      first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is some sample code and the result of running it.
    </p>

    <pre>fwrite_i32_be (stdout, 0x12345678);
fwrite_i32_le (stdout, 0x12345678);
fwrite_i16_be (stdout, 0xabcd);
fwrite_i16_le (stdout, 0xabcd);</pre>

    <pre>12 34 56 78 78 56 34 12 AB CD CD AB</pre>

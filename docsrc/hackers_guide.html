	<h2>Endianness</h2>

Some files contain numbers that have a fixed endianness,
independent from the endianness of the CPU DeuTex happens to run
on. These call for some special treatment, as the C language has
no provision for reading and writing integers otherwise than in
the native endianness.

<ul>
<p><li>To read an integer from a file with a particular endianness,
use use <code>fread_i16_le()</code>,
<code>fread_i16_be()</code>, <code>fread_i32_le()</code> and
<code>fread_i32_be()</code>. The first argument is the file
descriptor, the second argument is a pointer on a variable that
will receive the value read from the file.

<p><li>To write an integer to a file with a particular endianness,
use <code>fwrite_i16_le()</code>, <code>fwrite_i16_be()</code>,
<code>fwrite_i32_le()</code> and <code>fwrite_i32_be()</code>.
The first argument is the file descriptor, the second argument
is the value to write.

<p><li>To read an integer with a particular endianness from a
memory area, use <code>read_i16_le()</code>,
<code>read_i16_be()</code>, <code>read_i32_le()</code> and
<code>read_i32_be()</code>. The first argument is a pointer on
the memory area, the second argument is a pointer on a variable
that will receive the value read from the memory area.
Alternatively, you can use the <code>peek_i*()</code> functions
that take no second argument but instead return the read value.

<p><li>To write an integer with a particular endianness to a memory
area, use <code>write_i16_le()</code>,
<code>write_i16_be</code>, <code>write_i32_le()</code> and
<code>write_i32_be()</code>. The first argument is a pointer on
the memory area, the second argument is the value to write.

</ul>

Mnemonic to remember the arguments order&nbsp;: the object that
has a defined endianness is considered central and therefore
always comes first.

Here is some sample code and the result of running it.

<pre>
fwrite_i32_be (stdout, 0x12345678);
fwrite_i32_le (stdout, 0x12345678);
fwrite_i16_be (stdout, 0xabcd);
fwrite_i16_le (stdout, 0xabcd);
</pre>

<pre>
12 34 56 78 78 56 34 12 AB CD CD AB
</pre>

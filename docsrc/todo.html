	<h1>To-do list for DeuTex</h1>

<ul>
<li>In the directives file and textures files, "include" directive to include
the rest of another block/file.

<p><li>In the directives file and textures files, allow references to
environment variables (E.G. <code>$E(name)</code>)

<p><li>In the directives file and textures files, allow user variables (E.G.
    <code>$(name)</code>)

<p><li>Make it easier to let a texture have a description identical to another
texture

<p><li>In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all except
named flats as patches.

<p><li>In the directives file, add a mean to import all/only named/all except
named patches as flats. This implies 1) accepting flats larger than
64&times;64 (by clipping) 2) converting transparent pixels to a certain
colour (which one ?).

<p><li>In the directives file, add a mean to automatically generate a texture
for all/only named/all except named patches. The height of the automatic
texture is 128, its width is the least power of two wide enough to contain the
patch. The automatic texture is filled with the patch by tiling, starting from
the top left corner. The name of the automatic texture is the name of the
patch.

<p><li>Patches &gt; 255 high

<p><li>Make sure that support for Strife is complete.

<p><li>When doing <code>-xtract</code>/<code>-make</code> of
<code>strife0.wad</code>, creates <code>.au</code> sound files but is not able
to read them back ("<code>WAV: Can't read dsswish.au</code>" or something like
    that).

<p><li>Instead of allowing any and all characters in the script file, require
them to be quoted. And, when doing <code>-xtract</code>, produce the script
file with the appropriate quotes...  Since, under Unix, the only characters
that are not allowed in a file name are NUL and "<code>/</code>", I don't see
why DeuTex should prevent users from extracting lumps with weird characters in
their names.  However, that might cause compatilibity problems with the DOS
version.

<p><li>The presence of the GIF routines might prevent DeuTex to be distributed
in the main section of Debian. Would it be sufficient to #ifdef them out ?

<p><li>The command line interface is not always intuitive and fussy about the
position of certain options.

<p><li>Regarding audio support, Matthew W. Miller
&lt;<code>mattm@infinet.com</code>&gt; offered the following comment on
1999-07-04&nbsp;:

<blockquote>
<p>Audio handling in deutex (I'm referring to the irix
5.3 version's included source code) is, I believe, based on dmgraph, but
is pretty dire in any case.

<p>Imported sounds are all resampled to 11025 Hz, even though that
hasn't been necessary since some time between v1.2 and v1.666 (basically,
any version that uses the item-respawn sound has the improved sound
engine).  Exasperatingly, lxdoom (or maybe sndserv?) takes several steps
back by expecting sounds to be *raw* 11025 Hz data.  You may be able to
set new options to reflect this.

<p>Also, one would hope that eventually one or more of the source
ports will start to support bitrates other than 8 bit, and (maybe?) stereo
samples.  You may want to start leaning on various source ports'
programmers to get their acts together and start coming to some sort of
agreement.  ;)

<p>Importation of .wav files is pretty crufty.  Like dmgraph before
it, the deutex 5.3 source expects there to be just one big 'data' chunk,
and doesn't notice the 'info' chunks that certain stupid Windows programs
(*cough*cough*CoolEdit*GoldWave*cough*) insist on putting in (usually with
copyright messages for the program itself, which in a just world would be
illegal). Greater explanation of all this whacky chunk business can be
found at:
<a href="http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~maniac/resource_web/wav_file_format/">
<code>http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~maniac/resource_web/wav_file_format/</code></a>
(wav1.htm, wav2.htm, wav3.htm, 4.htm, 5.htm)

<p>Essentially, you want to clip out the first 'data' chunk and ignore crap
like 'info', 'inam', 'list', or whatever.
</blockquote>

<p><li>TBD: New options <code>-fstart</code> and <code>-fend</code> to control
the start-of-flats and end-of-flats markers used in pwads. Default to
<code>FF_START</code> and <code>F_END</code> respectively.
<strong>Warning:</strong> here again, don't use those options just because
they're here. The default markers are perfectly fine, and they conform to the
de-facto standard. If you deviate from them, you're asking for trouble.

<p><li><code>-f_end</code>

<p><li>In the doc, mention that negative patch Y-offsets are forced to 0 by
the engine.

<p><li>Why does DeuTex sometimes includes patches even if you don't mention
them explicitly and sometimes doesn't ?

<p><li>Make a DOS binary distribution with all filenames 8.3, all
documentation in CRLF &amp; CP437 format, no sources, no makefile, only DOS
executables.

<p><li>Options shouldn't care whether there is space between them and their
argument.

<p><li>Man page: mention that some options are DeuTex-only, not DeuSF.

<p><li>Man page: insert <code>`deutex -man`</code> automatically.

<p><li>Alpha port: look into 64-bit longs.

<p><li><code>-check</code> shouldn't require an argument. It should use the
iwad by default.

<p><li><code>-main</code> should be implemented for DeuTex as well.

<p><li>DeuTex should not look for <code>doom.wad</code> in the directory set
by <code>-heretic</code> !

<p><li>WAV to Doom sound: the warning "shrinking ... to 11025" should mention
the name of the file or appear only once.

<p><li>PPM to Doom graphics: the warning "quantisation is slow" should either
mention the name of the file or appear only once.

<p><li>Determine why converting Doom graphics to PPM and back does not yield
the same thing. This also happens with BMP but much less so.

<p><li>Bug: certain flats seem to be extracted with certain pixels set to the
transparent colour (Doom's <code>CEIL4_1</code>). DeuTex 3.6 for DOS exhibits
the same problem [1].

<p><li>Hexen: DeuTex does not handle the <code>BEHAVIOR</code> lumps correctly.

<p><li>Hexen: does not extract graphics quite correctly (applies transparent
colour translation to opaque images such as <code>FINALE1</code> and
<code>FINALE2</code>. This is probably related to [1].

<p><li>Hexen: when trying to build back the hexen wad, got
<pre>
Color palette is unknown
WARNING unknown palette. Using colour 0xff as transparentcolour.
Some graphics may appear moth-eaten.
Making lumps
Bug: *** idinx ***
</pre>

<p><li>WinTex status: add link to www.doomworld.com/deskdoom/
(thomas@uprun.com)

<p><li>Why does "<code>deutex -ipf alpha -doom .. -sprites -graphics -patches
-xtract</code>" trigger <code>"Error: *** Can't open file ./lumps/titlepic.lmp
***</code>"&nbsp;?

<p><li>When extracting the Doom alpha 0.2 iwad, "<code>Can't find PNAMES in
wad</code>".

<p><li>Alpha: extracting levels not possible yet. Some graphics are extracted
as lumps (<code>MSKUL*</code>, <code>TITLEPIC</code>...).

<p><li>Building seems to be slower than extracting. Perhaps RAWtoPIC could use
some optimization.

<p><li>Include the palettes in the distribution.

<h1>History of changes for DeuTex</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>DeuTex 4.4.902 (AYM 2005-08-31)
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Build: vanilla <code>make</code> compatibility: removed all occurrences
	of "<code>$&lt;</code>" not in inference rules in the makefile.

      <li>
	Build: vanilla <code>make</code> compatibility: removed all
	"<code>\</code>" followed by empty lines.
	On NCR MP-RAS, <code>make</code> quotes all empty lines that
	follow&nbsp;!

      <li>
	Build: there is now a "<code>./configure</code>" script (GNU autoconf
	work-alike).

	<p>
	  Installing somewhere else than <code>/usr/local</code> is now done by
	  giving <code>./configure</code> the <code>--prefix</code> option.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <code>CC</code>, <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code> are now
	  auto-detected.
	  The defaults can be overridden by passing <code>./configure</code>
	  the <code>--cc</code>, <code>--cflags</code> and
	  <code>--ldflags</code> options.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The fixed-size types (<code>Int16</code> etc.) are now correctly set
	  on all LP64 platforms, not just Alpha.
	</p>

      <li>
	Build: the OPTIONS section is now updated automatically.
	This impacts no-one but hackers.

      <li>
	Code: two <code>char[8]</code> were used as <code>char[9]</code>
	(caught by NCR/MetaWare <code>cc</code> on NCR MP-RAS).

      <li>
	Code: C89 compatibility: removed a few "<code>//</code>" comments that
	had slipped into the source.

      <li>
	Code: a few functions were declared as <code>static</code> but defined
	as <code>extern</code> (caught by NCR/MetaWare <code>cc</code> on NCR
	MP-RAS).

      <li>
	Code: <code>static</code>- and <code>const</code>-correctness fixes.

      <li>Code: removed the little-used <code>Legal()</code> function.

      <li>
	Doc: man page: in DESCRIPTION, added a short list of examples to help
	new users getting started.
	Added a FILES section.
	Made the SEE ALSO section a bit more specific.

      <li>
	Doc: in <code>--help</code> and the man page, divided the options into
	groups and sorted them alphabetically within each group.
	It seems to be clearer that way.

      <li>Doc: added a FAQ.

      <li>Doc: obfuscated all email addresses (<code>tr .@ +=</code>).

      <li>
	Game: Strife: the <code>SCRIPT<var>nn</var></code> lumps are now
	extracted in human-readable form into the <code>scripts/</code>
	directory.
	The reverse operation is not implemented.
	Since we understand the Strife script format only partially, the output
	format is still in flux.
	New option <code>-scripts</code> to extract only the scripts.
	The reverse engineering was done in collaboration with Matthew W.
	Miller.

      <li>
	Graphics: it's now possible to build wads that use a custom
	<code>PLAYPAL</code>.
	Previously, DeuTex always used the <code>PLAYPAL</code> from the iwad
	when building.
	It now uses the one in <code>lumps/</code> if it exists.
	Thanks to Ras2 for reporting the problem.

      <li>
	Graphics: rewrote <code>COLdiff()</code> as a macro.
	On my system, the time to build a wad made of a single 1M-pixel patch
	is down from 1.32s to 0.85s (35% faster), which is not surprising since
	DeuTex used to spend about 40% of its time in <code>COLdiff()</code>.
	The time to rebuild the Strife iwad is down from 8.6s to 7.2s (16%
	faster).

      <li>
	Graphics: removed the "quantisation is slow" warnings that DeuTex used
	to spew when composing from PPMs and 24-bit BMPs.
	Those warnings were relevant to an old quantisation algorithm that has
	not been used since at least version 3.8 (<code>#ifdef
	QUANTSLOW</code>).

      <li>
	Graphics: lifted the arbitrary limit of 256 patches per texture.
	DeuTex will now accept as many patches as the wad format allows
	(32,767).
	If a texture definition has more than that many patches, DeuTex will
	discard the excess patches with a warning, instead of dying with a
	cryptic message like "<code>Line <var>n</var>: Illegal char
	'*'</code>".

      <li>
	Graphics: lifted the arbitrary limit of 4096 on patch width.
	DeuTex now handles patches as wide as the wad format allows (32,767).

      <li>
	Graphics: textures wider than 4096 are now accepted with a warning.
	PrBoom 2.2.3 is known to take textures as wide as 16,384 pixels.
	8192&times;128 textures make XDoom 20001001 crash in
	<code>Z_Malloc</code>.
	1024&times;128 textures make Doom freeze in <code>R_Init</code>.
	The maximum acceptable widths might be higher if the height of the
	texture is lesser than 128 but I haven't looked into it.
	Thanks to David Damerell for testing.

      <li>Misc: removed the annoying startup banner.

      <li>
	Misc: if no command is given, emit a meaningful error message instead
	of suggesting to switch to WinTex.
	And exit with code 1 instead of 255.

      <li>
	Misc: all messages now look like this&nbsp;:

	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	    <code><var>c</var> <var>code</var> <var>string</var></code>
	  </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	  <var>c</var> is the class of the message&nbsp;: "<b>i</b>" for
	  information, "<b>w</b>" for warning, "<b>E</b>" for error, "<b>B</b>"
	  for bug.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <var>code</var> is a unique 4-character alphanumeric code which
	  unambiguously identifies the message.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Some of the messages have been rewritten to be more informative
	  (mention the filename, the nature of the error, etc.).
	</p>

      <li>
        <p>
	  Misc: at the request of Kim "Sparky" Parrott, all messages are now
	  copied to a file named "<code>deutex.log</code>"
	  ("<code>deusf.log</code>" for DeuSF).
	  The default log file name can be overridden through the
	  "<code>-log</code>" option.
	  If you don't want a log file, try "<code>-log /dev/null</code>"
	  (Unix) or "<code>-log nul</code>" (DOS).
	</p>

	<p>
	  The log is only written if a command that works with wads is given.
	  <code>--help</code>, <code>--version</code> etc. do not create a log.
	</p>

      <li>Misc: removed the 30 command-line arguments limit.

      <li>
	Misc: made exit status a little bit more normal (2 for errors and 3 for
	bugs instead of -5 and -10).

      <li>
	Sound: new option <code>-rate</code> to specify what DeuTex should do
	when including sound files whose sample rate is not exactly
	11025&nbsp;Hz.
	The choices are&nbsp;:

	<dl class="compact">
	  <dt><code>reject</code></dt>
	  <dd>consider it a fatal error and exit immediately with a non-zero
	    exit code.</dd>

	  <dt><code>force</code></dt>
	  <dd>emit a warning and force it to 11025&nbsp;Hz by resampling up or
	    down.</dd>

	  <dt><code>warn</code></dt>
	  <dd>emit a warning but include it as is anyway.</dd>

	  <dt><code>accept</code></dt>
	  <dd>silently include it as is.</dd>
	</dl>

	Previously, the default (and only option) used to be
	"<code>force</code>". It's now "<code>warn</code>".

	<p>
	  Thanks to Matthew W. Miller for telling me about this issue (which he
	  did in 1999&nbsp;; the six-year delay is mine, all mine).
	</p>

      <li>
	Sound: write errors while extracting PC speaker sounds are now actually
	detected and reported.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.4.0 (AYM 2000-01-05)
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Game: Hexen: musics are now identified and extracted properly.

	<p>The old music identification code assumed that any lump whose name
	does not begin with either "<code>D_</code>" or "<code>MUS_</code>"
	can't be a music. It worked for Doom, Heretic and Strife but, for
	Hexen, it caused all musics to be seen as plain lumps and extracted
	accordingly into the <code>lumps/</code> directory. DeuTex even tried
	to interprete <code>STALKR</code> and <code>WINNOWR</code> as pictures
	and said silly things about them having a "width greater than 4096".

	<p>The new code really checks whether the lump begins with
	"<code>MUS\x1a</code>" instead of just looking at its name. A lump is
	now deemed to be a music if and only if it begins with
	"<code>MUS\x1a</code>".

	<p>As a side-effect, certain operations (appending sprites and flats
	and merging) must have become slower. Furthermore, since these used to
	blindly assume that any lump whose name begins with either
	"<code>D_</code>" or "<code>MUS_</code>" is a music, their semantics
	might have changed. If you find they don't do what you want, try again
	using the <code>-musid</code> option and let me know whether it
	improves your condition.

	<li>Game: Hexen, Doom alpha 0.4/0.5: levels are now properly
	extracted and included.

	<p>There have been changes in the undocumented details of DeuTex's
	behaviour with respect to levels. The one that is most likely to be
	noticed is that, when including a level, DeuTex now copies the entire
	contents of the <code>levels/</code> pwad, starting from the level
	label. Previously, it included at most the 11 following lumps, and only
	if they had the expected names (<code>THINGS</code>,
	<code>VERTEXES</code> and so on).

	<p>But, basically, if the <code>levels/</code> pwads contain, as they
	should, all the needed lumps and nothing else, there shouldn't be any
	trouble.

	<li>Game: Heretic and Hexen: does not abort anymore with
	"<code>Bug: *** idinx (12) ***</code>" when trying to include the
	graphic lumps (resp. <code>CREDIT</code>, <code>E2END</code>,
	<code>FINAL1</code>, <code>FINAL2</code>, <code>HELP1</code>,
	<code>HELP2</code>, <code>TITLE</code> and <code>CREDIT</code>,
	<code>FINALE1</code>, <code>FINALE2</code>, <code>FINALE3</code>,
	<code>HELP1</code>, <code>HELP2</code>, <code>INTERPIC</code>,
	<code>TITLE</code>). More generally, DeuTex now accepts to compose wads
	even when there are graphic files in <code>lumps/</code>.

	<li>Game: Hexen: does not abort anymore with "<code>Height of FLAT
	./flats/x_001.ppm is not 64 or 65</code>" when trying to include flats
	<code>X_001</code> through <code>X_011</code>. In addition, DeuTex now
	just emits a warning instead of aborting for other oddball heights
	(i.e. not 64, 65 or 128). Have fun. <code>;-)</code> This is true for
	all iwads, not only Hexen.

	<li>Graphics: the annoying "<code>quantisation is slow</code>"
	warnings now appear at most once.
 
	<li>Misc: to disambiguate the "<code>&lt;count&gt; warnings
	omitted</code>" message, added optional scope prefix and changed the
	picture extraction function to use it.

	<li>Misc: got rid of the "don't bother Olivier" banner. People must
	have got the message by now.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.3.0 (AYM 1999-12-24)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>Graphics: fixed ancient bug where DeuTex sometimes failed to
	include custom patches if they were not explicitly listed in the
	<code>[patches]</code> section. If the first patch used in
	<code>texture1.txt</code> was a custom patch, it <em>had</em> to be
	listed in <code>[patches]</code> or DeuTex would forget to include it.
	This is the same bug Olivier mentioned in the home page&nbsp;:

	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	    <i>The support for wall patches in DeuTex has been modified. You
	    must now explicitely declare all your patches in a [PATCHE]
	    section.</i>

	  <p>
	    <i>If you don't do this, DeuTex will attempt to work as usual, but
	    there seems to ba a bug in this part of the code, so sometime some
	    needed patches are not loaded.</i>
	</blockquote>

	After some summary testing, looks like it's fixed.

	<li>Misc: more error handling improvements.

	<li>Misc: bumped version number and cleaned things up for public
	release.

	<li>Misc: decreased maximum number of warnings per picture from 10
	to 5.

	<li>Platform: fixed <code>ftruncate()</code> being undeclared when
	compiling with DJGPP and updated the building-on-DOS section of the
	doc.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.2.2 (AYM 1999-11-20) (not for public consumption)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>Misc: made certain failure messages more informative.
	
	<li>Platform: fixed several bugs that showed in the DOS precompiled
	executables for 4.1.0 and 4.2.0 (most common symptom : DeuTex aborting
	    with a "<code>Can't read WAD</code>" error message).

	<p>Lengthy technical explanation&nbsp;: in 4.1.0, I removed the
	"<code>huge</code>" pointer qualifiers that were scattered throughout
	the source not unlike nitrates in groundwater. The reasoning was that,
	since DeuTex is always compiled in the "huge" memory model anyway,
	those qualifiers were redundant. As I found out at the end of a long
	and painful debugging session, they weren't.

	<p>Had I read the doc of the compiler, I would have known that, even
	when in the huge memory model, pointers are "<code>far</code>" by
	default, not "<code>huge</code>". Far pointers wrap around at
	64&nbsp;kB&nbsp;; this is not what you want when you're trying to work
	with lumps larger than that. And, apparently, there is no way to
	specify that pointers should be huge by default.

	<p>On top of that, there was a genuine bug in
	<code>WADRreadBytes2()</code> that would have prevented the DOS port
	from working, even if all pointers had been huge. But this one was
	fixed in 4.2.1.

	<p>I switched to DJGPP, with which you can get working executables
	without having to contaminate your code with carcinogenic keywords. The
	bad news&nbsp;: firstly, the executables are somewhat larger. Secondly,
	since DJGPP executables use protected mode, they tend to be more fussy.

	<p>Thanks to Kim Parrott for reporting the bug and alpha testing my
	fixes.

	<p>All the above applies only to the DOS precompiled executables. Other
	platforms did not have these problems.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.2.1 (AYM 1999-11-16) (not for public consumption)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>CLI: fixed segfault on "<code>deutex --vers</code>".

	<li>Graphics: new option <code>-usedidx</code>. When called with
	this option, DeuTex scans all the graphics in the wad and prints
	statistics about which palette indices they use. (By "graphics" is meant
	"any data that is converted into an RGB triplet by looking up
	<code>PLAYPAL</code> or <code>TITLEPAL</code>". That includes flats,
	graphics, patches, sneaps, sneats and sprites.) I've added this command
	for my own use, to help me decide which index should be used to store
	the transparent colour for Hexen.

	<li>Misc: made certain failure messages more informative.
	
	<li>Misc: made printing of lump names garbage-proof.

	<li>Platform: fixed a huge DOS bug that made DeuTex fail with
	a "<code>Can't read WAD</code>" error whenever it had to read more
	than 65535 bytes from a wad at once.

	<li>Platform: flushing <code>stdout</code> before writing to
	<code>stderr</code> so that messages come out in the right order when
	both outputs are redirected.

	<li>Sound: all conditions that used to be fatal errors when
	extracting sound lumps now just elicit a warning message, indicating
	which lump it was and what action was taken.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.2.0 (AYM 1999-11-14)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>Doc: fixed error in documentation of <code>-pkgfx</code>,
	<code>-pknormal</code> and <code>-usedtex</code>.

	<li>Game: Strife: fixed DeuTex aborting when extracting textures
	for versions of Strife &gt;=&nbsp;1.1. The problem was that
	Strife&nbsp;1.1 and above use a different format for the
	<code>TEXTURE1</code> and <code>TEXTURE2</code> lumps (Strife&nbsp;1.0
	uses the same format as Doom). New options "<code>-tf
	strife11</code>", "<code>-itf strife11</code>" and "<code>-otf
	strife11</code>" to support that format. Option <code>-strife</code>
	has been changed to imply "<code>-tf strife11</code>". New option
	<code>-strife10</code> that is identical to <code>-strife</code>
	except that it does <em>not</em> imply "<code>-tf strife11</code>".
	Summary&nbsp;:

	<ul>
	<li>if you have the Strife&nbsp;1.0 iwad, use "<code>-strife10</code>"
	(or "<code>-tf normal</code>"),

	<li>if you have Strife&nbsp;1.1 or above, use "<code>-strife</code>"
	(or "<code>-tf strife11</code>").
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks to Kim Parrott for reporting the bug and Len Pitre for
	pointing me in the right direction.

	<li>Sound: fixed two bugs in reading Sun audio (<code>.au</code>)
	files. Fixes error "<code>WAV: can't read data
	of./sounds/foo.au</code>" (sic) when trying to build a wad. One of
	these bugs prevented from reading Sun audio files on little-endian
	machines. It had been there for a long time&nbsp;; v3.8 has it and the
	v3.6 binary behaves like it had it too. I doubt that anyone had ever
	been able to use <code>.au</code> files on little-endian machines
	before.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.1.0 (AYM 1999-11-01)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>CLI: new options <code>-sneas</code>, <code>-sneaps</code> and
	<code>-sneats</code>.

	<li>Code: removed all occurrences of "<code>huge</code>" on the
	theory that, on platforms where it's meaningful, we always use the
	huge memory model anyway.

	<li>Code: replaced certain occurrences of "<code>Int32</code>" by
	"<code>iolen_t</code>".

	<li>Code: replaced certain occurrences of "<code>256</code>" by
	"<code>NCOLOURS</code>".

	<li>Doom alpha 0.4: <code>AMENA0</code> and <code>MSKUL*</code> are
	now correctly recognized as graphics and not as lumps anymore. The 21
	graphic lumps that ended up in <code>lumps/</code> are now properly
	extracted (into <code>sneaps/</code> and <code>sneats/</code>). (The
	first item involved propagating to <code>IDENTgraphic()</code> the
	changes made to <code>PICtoRAW()</code> in v. 4.0.2. The second item
	needed heavy hacking, creating a new image type (christened "snea")
	and managing an alternate palette for <code>TITLEPAL</code>.) Still
	extracted as lumps&nbsp;: <code>GNUM[0-9]</code> and
	<code>HUFONT</code>.

	<li>Doom alpha 0.5: the 86 graphic lumps that ended up in
	<code>lumps/</code> are now properly extracted (into
	<code>sneaps/</code> and <code>sneats/</code>). Still extracted as
	lump&nbsp;: <code>HUFONT</code>.

	<li>Graphics: errors that used to cause DeuTex to give up on
	extracting a picture now just make it skip the rest of column. It also
	prints detailed messages about what it didn't like and in which picture
	it occurred instead of bailing out silently.

	<li>Misc: new option <code>-di</code> to debug entry
	identification. Useful mainly to hackers.

	<li>Misc: cosmetic changes in the generated
	<code>wadinfo.txt</code> and in the phase messages.

	<li>Misc: no more messages "<code>Creating PWAD</code>" and
	"<code>WAD is complete...</code>" during level extraction.

	<li>Misc: set a limit of 10 warnings per picture, to prevent
	invalid pictures from uselessly flooding the output.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.3 (AYM 1999-10-02)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>CLI: new option <code>-doom2</code> as suggested by Matthew
	Miller.

	<li>Graphics: now accepts to extract pictures as large as
	4096&times;4096 (previously the limit was 320&times;200). This fixes
	"<code>Failed to write sprite</code>" errors when trying to extract
	<code>PSYBA0</code> and <code>PSYBB0</code> from
	<code>strain.wad</code>. Thanks to Matthew miller for reporting the
	bug.

	<li>Misc: added a useful URL to the GIF warning.

	<li>Platform: now builds without errors on FAT filesystems
	(replaced <code>.deutex</code> and <code>.deusf</code> by
	<code>tmp/_deutex</code> and <code>tmp/_deusf</code>).

	<li>Sound: fixed a bug that caused DeuTex to extract sounds with
	unlikely sample rates like 4&nbsp;GHz whenever the sample rate in the
	lump was higher than 32767&nbsp;Hz (for example <code>DSVILACT</code>
	and <code>DSVILSIT</code> from <code>ncc1701.wad</code>, with a sample
	rate of 44.1&nbsp;kHz). Thanks to Matthew Miller for reporting the
	bug.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.2 (AYM 1999-09-19)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>CLI: new options
	
	  <ul>
	  <li><code>-doom02</code> (implies <code>-ipf alpha</code>,
	  <code>-itf none</code> and <code>-itl none</code>)

	  <li><code>-doom04</code> (implies <code>-ipf alpha</code>,
	  <code>-itf nameless</code> and <code>-itl textures</code>)

	  <li><code>-doom05</code> (implies <code>-ipf alpha</code> and
	  <code>-itl textures</code>)

	  <li><code>-doompr</code> (implies <code>-ipf pr</code>)

	  </ul>

	<p>Use those options where you would have used <code>-doom</code> and
	friends. For example, to extract the contents of the Doom 0.4 iwad
	that is in <code>c:\doom0_4</code>, type "<code>deutex -doom04
	c:\doom0_4 -xtract</code>".

	<li>Code: replaced certain unjustified uses of <code>Int32</code>
	by <code>long</code>.

	<li>Doc: removed <code>old/readme.txt</code>. It's so out of date
	that it's more confusing than useful.

	<li>Game: Doom alpha and Doom PR: it's now possible to extract
	graphics, patches, sprites and textures from those iwads. Three new
	options&nbsp;:

	  <dl>
	  <dt><code>-ipf {normal|pr|alpha}</code>
	  <dd>Use <code>alpha</code> for Doom alpha 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5.<br>Use
	  <code>pr</code> for Doom PR (press release pre-beta).<br>Use
	  <code>normal</code> for everything else.

	  <dt><code>-itf {normal|nameless|none}</code>
	  <dd>Use <code>none</code> for Doom alpha 0.2.<br>Use
	  <code>nameless</code> for Doom alpha 0.4.<br>Use <code>normal</code>
	  for everything else, including Doom alpha 0.5.

	  <dt><code>-itl {normal|textures|none}</code>
	  <dd>Use <code>none</code> for Doom alpha 0.2.<br>Use
	  <code>textures</code> for Doom alpha 0.4 and 0.5.<br>Use
	  <code>normal</code> for everything else, including Doom alpha 0.5.

	  </dl>

	<p>You shouldn't ever have to use those options directly. It's better
	to use just <code>-doom02</code>, <code>-doom04</code>,
	<code>-doom05</code> and <code>-doompr</code>, which take care of
	setting ipf, itf and itl properly for you.

	<p>Note that extracting levels and some other lumps from the Doom
	alpha iwads does not work yet.

	<li>Platform: new target in the makefile to generate a binary DOS
	distribution with the executables and the user documentation in DOS
	format, with DOS-ish names.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.1 (AYM 1999-09-10)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>CLI: reworked the command line arguments parsing, with
	the following consequences.

	  <ul>
	  <li>Options can now be abbreviated freely, as long as the
	  abbreviation is not ambiguous. For example, you can use
	  <code>-heretic</code>, <code>-hereti</code>, <code>-heret</code>,
	  <code>-here</code> or <code>-her</code> but not <code>-he</code>
	  because that could also be the abbreviation for <code>-help</code>
	  (or <code>-hexen</code>, for that matter). On the other hand,
	  <code>-h</code> <em>is</em> allowed because it's not an abbreviation
	  (there's really a <code>-h</code> option).

	  <li><code>-heretic</code> and <code>-hexen</code> now work (they
	  were "hidden" by <code>-h[elp]</code>). 

	  <li><code>-v<var>@</var></code> has been split in <code>-v0</code>,
	  <code>-v1</code> ... <code>-v5</code> because the new code does not
	  allow excess characters after an option.
	  <code>-v<var>string</var></code> where <var>string</var> is anything
	  else than "<code>0</code>" through "<code>5</code>" now triggers an
	  error (it used to be accepted silently). I hope no one relied on the
	  old undocumented behaviour.

	  <li>Certain silly command line arguments that would have worked
	  before would now trigger an error. For example, it used to be
	  possible to type <code>-extramarital</code> or
	  <code>-extermination</code> for <code>-extract</code> but not
	  anymore. The old code defined relatively short options
	  (<code>-ext</code>) and accepted command line arguments as long as
	  the defined option was an initial substring of the command line
	  argument. The new code does the reverse; it defines relatively long
	  options (<code>-extract</code>) and accepts command line argument as
	  long as they're an initial substring of the defined option.

	  </ul>

	<li>Code: replaced direct testing of <code>__MSDOS__</code>,
	<code>__OS2__</code>, <code>__GNUC__</code>,
	<code>__BORLANDC__</code> by <code>DT_CC</code> and
	<code>DT_OS</code>. This is hopefully going to make Udo's job a
	bit easier.

	<li>Code: now uses the same <code>fopen()</code> modes for
	all platforms: "<code>{rw}b</code>" for binary mode and
	"<code>{rw}</code>" for text mode, as per the ANSI/ISO C
	standard. This will fix the problem Udo Munk reported with the
	Cygwin build opening binary files in text mode and thus failing
	miserably. Note that certain DOS C compilers can be configured
	so that "<code>{rw}</code>" opens files in <em>binary</em> mode.
	Don't do that&nbsp;! If you have problems with text files on
	DOS, make sure your C compiler is configured so that
	"<code>{rw}</code>" opens files in <em>text</em> mode.

	<li>Code: added to the distribution archive
	<code>gifcodec.c</code> that I had forgotten to include (it's
	not used anyway).

	<li>Code: added to the distribution archive
	<code>src/{deusf,deusfos,deutex,deutexos}.def</code> that I had
	forgotten to include. I guess that's Windows/OS/2-only stuff.

	<li>Doc: updated <code>making.txt</code> and renamed it as
	<code>INSTALL</code> for homogeneity. Removed obsolete reference
	to <code>alpha.sh</code> and the file itself.

	<li>Doc: made more legal updates.

	<li>Doc: documented <code>DOOMWADDIR</code> in the man page.

	<li>Misc: changed the default graphics format for Unix from
	GIF to PPM, so that fewer user sites are broken if and when GIF
	support is removed. For the same reason, added a warning message
	when <code>-gif</code> is used or the first time an image is
	read from a GIF file.

	<li>Misc: changed the lookup order for images to PPM, BMP,
	GIF (was BMP, GIF, PPM).

	<li>Platform: fixed a couple of things that didn't work on
	16-bit platforms (real-mode DOS).

	<li>Platform: now compiles on DOS with Borland C++ 4.0.
	
	<li>Platform: now compiles on DOS with MSC 6.0. The MSC 6.0
	build is functional but limited because it can't allocate blocks
	larger than 64 kB, which is insufficient for certain images. I
	can't use <code>halloc()</code> instead of <code>malloc()</code>
	because it does not supporting resizing (i.e. there's no
	<code>hrealloc()</code> function).

	<li>Platform: in response to Udo's remarks, DJGPP and Cygwin
	are now properly identified (<code>__DJGPP__</code> and
	<code>__CYGWIN__</code>).

	<li>Platform: added sanity checks on specified-size types
	<code>Int32</code> and friends.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.0a3 (AYM 1999-09-05)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>Code: removed incongruous <code>#define</code>-ing of
	<code>O_BINARY</code> and <code>SEEK_SET</code>.

	<li>Code: after Udo Munk's report, fixed warnings in
	  <ul class="compact">
	  <li><code>src/color.c(74)</code>
	  <li><code>src/ident.c(583)</code>
	  <li><code>src/ident.c(658)</code>
	  <li><code>src/mkwad.c(78)</code>
	  <li><code>src/mkwad.c(79)</code>
	  <li><code>src/mkwad.c(80)</code>
	  <li><code>src/mkwad.c(81)</code>
	  <li><code>src/picture.c(903)</code>
	  <li><code>src/picture.c(912)</code>
	  </ul>

	<li>Doc: updated <code>making.txt</code>.

	<li>Legal: as agreed to by Olivier Montanuy, DeuTex is now
	entirely GPL'd. Well, <em>almost</em> entirely, since it
	includes code written by different authors in <code>lzw.c</code>
	and elsewhere. Changed the notices in the source files and added
	new file <code>LICENSE</code> to clarify things.

	<li>Makefile: should now work with all C compilers (removed
	<code>-Wall</code> from <code>CFLAGS</code>).

	<li>Makefile: <code>clean</code> now removes the DOS
	executables if they exist.

	<li>Makefile: does not compile with debug information in by
	default anymore.

	<li>Makefile: new targets <code>dall</code>,
	<code>ddt</code>, <code>dds</code>, <code>ddeutex</code>
	and <code>ddeusf</code> for compiling with debug
	information and all warnings.

	<li>Makefile: new target <code>help</code>.

	<li>Makefile: new target <code>distdos</code>.

	<li>Platform: replaced <code>unlink()</code> by
	<code>remove()</code> for portability. Thanks to Udo for
	reporting this.

	<li>Platform: on 8.3 filesystems, make should not choke on
	<code>docsrc/changes.html</code> anymore. Thanks to Udo for
	reporting this.

	<li>Sound: corrected some misleading endianness
	comments in <code>sound.c</code>.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.0a2 (AYM 1999-08-14)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>Game: easier to use with Strife (now looks for
	"<code>strife1.wad</code>", new option "<code>-strife</code>").

	<li>Game: easier to use with Hexen (new option
	"<code>-hexen</code>").

	<li>Command line: new options "<code>-hexen</code>" and
	"<code>-strife</code>".

	<li>Command line: new option "<code>--version</code>" (prints
	version number and returns 0).

	<li>Doc: various changes in the man page, in the output of
	"<code>-help</code>" and "<code>-man</code>" and elsewhere.

	<li>Makefile: various improvements.

	<li>Distribution: set modes straight.

    </ul>

  <dt>DeuTex 4.0.0a1 (AYM 1999-08-12)
  <dd>
    <ul>
	<li>General: fixed many segfaults that were caused by
	attempts to <code>fclose (NULL)</code>.

	<li>Game: Strife is now supported.

	<li>Wad: new options <code>-be</code>, <code>-le</code>,
	<code>-ibe</code>, <code>-ile</code>, <code>-obe</code> and
	<code>-ole</code> to control the endianness of the wads.
	<strong>Caution</strong>: don't use them if you don't know what
	you're doing&nbsp;! As far as I know, wads are always
	little-endian regardless of the architecture of the host.
	Therefore, I see no reason for someone in his/her right mind to
	create a big-endian wad. Those options are here more for the
	sake of completeness than anything else.

	<li>Wad: made "<code>%</code>" legal in names, to deal with
	Strife's "<code>INVFONG%</code>" and
	"<code>INVFONY%</code>".

	<li>Wad, graphics: end-of-flats marker is now
	<code>F_END</code> by default instead of <code>FF_END</code>.
	The reason for this change is that, with <code>F_END</code>, you
	don't need DeuSF to get Doom to see your new flats. Should you
	need to, it's still possible to get <code>FF_END</code> by using
	<code>-fend</code>.

	<li>Graphics: the default transparent colour is now a dark
	blue-green (rgb:00/2f/2f). It used to be cyan (rgb:00/ff/ff)
	which was blindingly bright, especially compared to the usually
	dark colours used in Doom textures. It's no fun to tweak shades
	of dark brown on a cyan background.

	<p>To reuse images done with/for a previous version of DeuTex,
	you need to either invoke DeuTex with "<code>-rgb 0 255
	255</code>" or convert your images by replacing all occurrences
	of colour (0, 255, 255) by colour (0, 47, 47). To preserve
	compatibility with WinTex, I didn't change the default
	transparent colour in WinTex mode&nbsp;; it's still (0, 255,
	255).

	<li>Graphics: fixed segfaults due to bug in conversion of
	bitmap images to Doom pictures. Occured in certain 2-pixel high
	images such as <code>STBFN045</code> in the Strife iwad.

	<li>Graphics: now supports pictures and textures up to 509
	high (was limited to 128).

	<li>Graphics: now supports pictures and textures up to 1024
	wide (was limited to 512).

	<li>Graphics: new option "<code>-pf</code>" to deal with the
	different picture format in the Doom alpha iwad (the underlying
	functionality is not implemented yet&nbsp;!)

	<li>Graphics: using <code>-ppm</code> does not cause anymore
	DeuTex to abort with "<code>Bug: *** psvit ***</code>".

	<li>Graphics: fixed "<code>-ppm</code>" message.

	<li>Sound, platform: a bug that must have prevented reading
	<code>.wav</code> files on big endian machines has been
	squashed.

	<li>Command line: options can't start with a slash
	("<code>/</code>") anymore. I don't think anyone used it and was
	a silly feature for a Unix program.

	<li>Command line: not case insensitive anymore.
	
	<li>Command line: changed the wording of error messages to
	use "option" instead of "command".

	<li>Command line: added options "<code>-?</code>" and
	"<code>--help</code>" as synonyms for "<code>-help</code>".

	<li>Doc: new option "<code>-man</code>" to print help in
	<code>troff -man</code> source format for inclusion in the man
	page.

	<li>Doc: the version number is now a free-form string.

	<li>Doc: Made on-line help more compact.

	<li>Doc: updated "<code>making.txt</code>".

	<li>Doc: made a proper <code>README</code> file.

	<li>Makefile: renamed "<code>unix</code>" target as
	"<code>strip</code>".

	<li>Makefile: new target "<code>install</code>".

	<li>Makefile: new target "<code>dist</code>".

	<li>Platform: reworked the handling of endianness. DeuTex
	used to deal with that through a set of macros that swapped
	bytes whenever the required endianness was not the same as the
	native endianness. To known the native endianness, DeuTex relied
	on a macro defined via <code>-D</code>.

	<p>There were two problems with this scheme. Firstly, Olivier
	got the meaning of "little endian" and "big endian" backwards
	and defining <code>LITTLE_ENDIAN</code> in fact caused DeuTex to
	believe it was being compiled for a big endian machine. As the
	glibc headers happen to define <code>LITTLE_ENDIAN</code> if the
	machine is little endian, compiling DeuTex on a glibc little
	endian Linux system was impossible unless you made changes to
	the source.

	<p>The other, more fundamental, objection against the old
	approach is that, as it needed the user to tell it about the
	native endianness by modifying the makefile, it prevented
	unattended builds and made things difficult for naive users.

	<p>The new method eliminates this problem by using a different
	algorithm that does not need to know the native endianness. The
	end result is that you don't have to worry about endianness
	anymore.

	<li>Internal: in <code>TXTinit()</code>, removed useless
	"<code>% 0xFF</code>" in index of <code>TXTval</code>.
